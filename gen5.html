<h3> Figurative Meanings </h3>

<ul>
<li> 1:14,15 "for times and seasons ... and to give light upon the earth" 
Psalm 19
<p>
Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which
is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen
him go into heaven.  Acts 1:11
<p>
"Seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of
God. Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth."
Col. 3:1-2 
<p>
"Look at the heavens and see; And behold the clouds-- they are higher than
you." Job 35:5
<li> 1:22 "And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes."  John 21:6  John 6  Numbers 11:31
 Revelation 8:9 
</ul>

<h3>Literal Interpretations</h3>

<ul>
<li> 1:14 Augustine notes, "And if time was even before the heavenly bodies,
not indeed marked by hours, days, months, and years,—for these measures of
time’s periods which are commonly and properly called times, did manifestly
begin with the motion of the heavenly bodies, and so God said, when He
appointed them, “Let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and for
years..."

<li> 1:16 "And God made" from preexisting materials - as opposed to
	"created".  "The greater light to rule the day" -
	This is the most direct support for the Framework Theory. 
	These are the rulers of the realms of light and darkness.
<li> 1:17 "set them in the firmament".  This seems to fit perfectly
	with Aristotle's cosmology of stars embedded in the celestial
	sphere.
	<p>
	Big Bang: oxygenation turns atmosphere 
	transparent, so that the Sun, moon, and stars appear.  Note that
	there is a perfectly good Hebrew word for "appear" from day 3
	that is not used here.  

<li> 1:20 "And God said, Let there be..."  Framework: rulers of the sea
	and sky.  
	<p>
	In the Framework theory, "Let there be" is not a command, but a design
	statement. Anthropomorphically, imagine God sitting at a desk
	drawing up plans for the new creation and muttering to Himself
	"let there be this" and "let's do that".  Augustine reasoned
	that God was talking to the angels created and/or enlightened on
	day 1. A "seminar for the angels".  Think of it as the "Making of"
	included with a movie DVD.  The days in the "making of" are
	literal days, but unrelated to the days in the story told by
	the movie.

<li> 1:21 "And God created" - Contrast with Day 3 where God commanded and the
	earth brought forth.  This seems to support the Young Earth position
	with all the kinds created at once.  Big Bang commentators generally
	have God creating initial organisms, which then diversify via
	evolution.  (Evolution cannot produce the first living things by
	definition - mutation depends on self-reproduction.)  Michael Behe is a
	proponent of this model, pointing to "irreducible complexity" as a
	barrier to creating wholly new genetic code.
<li> 1:22 "And there shall be no more death." Rev 21:4
	<p>
	Was there death before the fall?  The Young Earth theory suggests
	that there was no death, and sees the deaths of billions of
	organisms implied by evolution as a horrific underpinning of the Garden
	of Eden.  The world before the fall was radically different from the
	world after the flood that we now inhabit, so this is a valid
	argument.  A counter argument is that death of cells is how our 
	hair grows, our skin renews, our blood recycles, etc.  Was
	no renewal needed before the fall?  Where
	do you draw the line between "good" death and "bad"?  What is death?
	<p>
	However, it is often suggested that there was "no entropy" before
	the fall.  This is a mathematical claim, and is almost certainly
	false, and shows a lack of understanding of entropy.  If they
	mean literally, "no entropy", there would be no information - the
	ultimate nothing, recalling Genesis 1:2.  If they mean "no increasing
	entropy", there would be no new history (no change) - like a dead
	statue.  
	<p>
	What they might be trying to say is that there was a continuous and
	infinite supply of order from God, so that the creation was
	immortal (not unlike the outdated "continuous creation" secular
	cosmology) until it died in the fall, by being cut off from the
	source of life.
