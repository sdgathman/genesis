<h4> Genesis 30:25-31:55 </h4>

<h3> Discerning the will of God </h3> 

God told Jacob he would return: Gen 28:15.  But when?
<ol>
<li> A desire to return: 30:25
<li> Circumstances warrant returning soon: 31:1
<li> God tells him to return now: 31:3
<li> His wives confirm the wisdom of returning now: 31:16 
<li> Jacob returns: 31:21
</ol>

<h3> Dominant DNA </h3>

<ul>
<li> 30:25 Jacob feels it might be time to return.
<li> 30:27 Again, the Lord blessed Laban for Jacob's sake, just as
	he blessed Abimelech 2 for Isaac's sake.  (And Abimelech 1 for
	Abraham's sake.)
<li> 30:30 But Jacob has wives and children, and no assets as of yet.
<li> 30:31 So he stays longer to work for some livestock.
<li> 30:32 The speckled and spotted would be dominant (and brown goats), and
	Jacob may have had some idea of genetics.  This arrangement
	gave him 75% of the increase.  The "pure" sheep and goats were more
	highly prized - hence Laban agrees to the deal.
<li> 30:37 On the other hand, the rods seemed to be superstition. God tells
	him later in a dream (31:10) that it was His doing, not Jacob's.
	But some commentators believe that this was a symbolic act at
	God's instruction, although not mentioned in 31:10.
<li> 30:41 While the dominant genetics would get him the majority of the
	flocks, Jacob's thought that the rods would get him the strongest
	of the flocks as well.  There is no known basis for this today,
	but the ancients had a number of secrets we've never figured out.
	Or Jacob was superstitious.
<li> 30:43 In any case Jacob obtained plenty of assets.
</ul>

<h3> Time to Leave </h3>

<ul>
<li> 31:1 And now the sons of Laban are openly envious.
<li> 31:2 And Laban is not as thrilled with Jacob.  Circumstances indicate
	that now is the time to return.  He has assets, and is losing his
	welcome.
<li> 31:3 And now God confirms that it is time to leave.
<li> 31:4 Jacob also consults with his wives to confirm that he really
	heard from God.  Important principle: God doesn't mind repeating
	himself.  If you hear from God, don't be afraid to ask for
	confirmation.
<li> 31:14 Laban did not provide anything for his daughters.
<li> 31:16 So the wives are ready to go also.
<li> 31:19 In addition to divination, the teraphim were used like a
	deed to the property of Laban.  Rachel was scheming to obtain
	the inheritance due her.  Sound familiar?
<p>
	teraphim: image of a man used for divination<br>
	Genesis 31:34	sometimes portable<br>
	Judges 18, Ezekiel 21:21, Hosea 3:4	used for divination<br>
	1 Samuel 15:23	condemned<br>
	1 Samuel 19:13	shape of a man<br>
	Zechariah 10:2	false information<br>
<li> 31:20 Jacob left when Laban was 3 days journey away for sheep
	shearing. Genesis 30:36
<li> 31:22 Laban is mad - first at not saying goodbye (31:27),
	second at losing his teraphim (31:30).
<li> 31:24 As promised, God is still looking out for Jacob wherever he
	goes.
<li> 31:43 Laban: Why should I destroy my own daughters and (former) wealth?
<li> 31:44 Once again, a covenant.
<li> 31:54 As with Abraham and Isaac with Abimelech, Jacob makes a covenant,
	offers a sacrifice, and eats a feast to celebrate the covenant.
	This pattern is repeated with the Passover and the Lord's Supper.
</ul>
