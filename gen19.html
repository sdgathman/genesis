<h3> Genesis 14 </h3>

<h4> The Rescue of Lot </h4>

<ul>
<li> 14:1 Shinar - where Babylon was built.  Elam - Iran before
	the Medes and Persians.
<li> 14:1-3 Nine kings plus Abram's army make 10 kings at war 
	in a valley in the middle east.  This foreshadows the
	10 kings of Revelation.  The deliverance of Lot foreshadows
	the deliverance of the Jewish remnant from the anti-christ.
<li> 14:10 "full of tar pits" - warning of judgement to come.
<li> 14:11-12 Lot could not be distinquished from the people of Sodom by
	the Elamites.
<li> 14:13 Abram is allied with the Amorites, for whose sake Israel's
	conquest of the land is delayed 400 years (15:16).
<li> 14:14 Abram is quite bold, Proverbs 28:1 "The righteous are as bold
	as a lion."  He is also quite rich, being able to field a fully
	equipped army against 4 kings from his personal servants.
<li> 14:18 Melchizedek is identified with Shem in Jewish tradition, and Shem
	is contemporaneous according to the genealogy in Genesis 10.  However,
	the Scripture makes a point of *not* giving any details concerning
	Melchizedek, so that Hebrews 7:1-3 states, "For this Melchizedek, king
	of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from
	the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him;  To whom also Abraham gave
	a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of
	righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is, King of
	peace;  Without father, without mother, without descent, having neither
	beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto the Son of God;
	abideth a priest continually."
	<p>
	Joshua 10 - The king of Jerusalem is still called Adonai Zedek.
	<p>
	"Brought forth bread and wine." - a type of the way Christ provides
	out spiritual food and drink.
	<p>
	Melchizedek, King of Salem - righteousness before peace.  <br>
	Romans 5:1 "Being justified by faith, we have peace with God."
	Isaiah 32:17 "And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the
	effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever."

<li> 14:22-23 "I have lifted up my hand" - Abram had made a vow not to take
	spoil for himself.
<li> 14:24 But he does not forget to recognize the claim of those who shared
	in his peril.
