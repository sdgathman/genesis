<h3> Genesis 12 </h3>

<h4> The Calling of Abram </h4>

<ul>
<li> 12:1 As Acts 7 confirms, this command came while Abram was still in Ur.
Terah means "delay".  God spoke to him while he was still in Ur, saying "leave
your father's house".  He did not immediately obey.
<li> 12:3 "I will bless them that bless thee, and curse them that curse thee."
<br>
Ezekiel 34:17-31	"I will judge between the rams and the goats."<br>
Matthew 25		"He will judge between the sheep and the goats."<br>
While Matthew 25 is often interpreted to refer to individuals and their
attention to the poor (and that is also valid), the context actually
refers to the judgement of nations according to their treatment of Israel.  
<p>
Discuss the fall of nations in history and their policy toward Jews.
<p>
"In thee all the nations of the earth will be blessed."  Looking ahead - 18:18 22:18 26:4 Revelation 7:9 <br>
Galatians 3:8 "Preached the Gospel unto Abraham"
<li> 12:4 Despite Abram's failure to immediately obey, Hebrews 11:8 as here
records only that he obeyed.  Taking Lot, however, was a compromise that
would cause trouble later - for Lot even more so than Abraham.
<li> 12:6-7 "Appeared unto Abram."  Obey the light that you have, and He gives
more light.  The name "Ur" (אוֹר) means "light".  The name "Moreh" means 
"instruction".  (Sichem means "ridge" or "shoulder".) 
<li> 12:10 God did not tell Abram to go to Egypt.  There are consequences.
It often takes more faith to *stay* in Caanan than to get there.  
Abram stumbles, and those around him suffer.  Sarai, Hagar, Lot, Pharaoh.
<li> 12:13 "sister" - Sarai is actually Abram's half sister, 20:12.
<li> 12:15 Here Sarai acquires a handmaiden named Hagar.
<li> 12:16 Lot is contaminated by a love of riches, as we see next chapter.
<li> 12:17 Abram lied, Pharaoh gets the plagues.
<li> 12:18 Pharaoh understood God's message, and rebukes Abram.
<li> 12:20 Abram is right back were he started - 13:4
</ul>
