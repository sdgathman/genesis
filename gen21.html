<h3> Genesis 16 </h3>

<h4> The Son of the Bondwoman </h4>

In the journey from Ur to Moriah, Abram faces many tests of faith.  His
performance is mixed: here is how I would grade him so far:

<ol>
<li> ½ Leave your country and kindred, and go to a land I will show you.
<li> × Stay in land despite famine
<li> √ Do not covet land
<li> √ Courage to take arms and wisdom to do so with God's guidance
<li> √ Fulfil vow and do not covet spoils of war 
<li> ½ Trust God's promise of a "seed from your loins"
</ol>

Abraham exemplifies justification by faith - but is far from perfect.  
Hallelujah!  God's covenant with Abram is unconditional
and does not depend on Abram's performance.
In chapter 15 he "believed God".  In chapter 16 he (and Sarai) "walk
according to the flesh".

<ul>
<li> 16:2 "that I may obtain children by her." The  Amorite
<a href="http://iws.collin.edu/mbailey/hammurabi%27s%20code%20overview.htm">
code of Hammurabi</a> provides for surrogate motherhood.
	<br>
	"And Abram hearkened unto his wife." Compare 3:6
<li> 16:3 
	Abram is 85, and Sarai is 75, and it is 10 years since God promised
	Abram a Seed.  They decide that God intends for them to use other
	means.  This decision typifies the "works of the flesh".  (Galations
	4:23)
	<br>
"to be his wife" - God does not recognize this "marriage" (16:9,21:13).  
<li> 16:4 The "work of the flesh" is immediately evident, Galations 5:19-21
<li> 16:5 Compare 3:12
<li> 16:7 The "Angel of the LORD" is Christ.  He finds a woman at a well
	and changes the direction of her life (John 4).
	Hagar typifies bondage to the law (Galatians 4:21-5:1), but
	she is still loved by God as a person and the recipient of His
	grace.
<li> 16:9 Jesus bids her to return to her post, and annuls her "marriage".
	God himself will set her and Ishmael free after another 13 years of
	service.  
<li> 16:11 Ishmael means "God hears"
<li> 16:12 "in the presence of" - actually "in the face of",
	similar idea
	to "sinners before the LORD" in 13:13.  This prophecy is not
	specifically about Ishmael, but about his descendents.
<li> 16:14 לַחַ֖י lahay - "that lives" or "to life".  He is 
	the living God, and the God of the living, and <big>לחי</big> is an 
	important symbol in Jewish culture.
</ul>
