<h4> Abrahams Second Wife </h4>

<ol>
<li> 25:1 "again Abraham took a wife" - "the gifts and calling of God are
	without repentance." Romans 11:29
<li> 25:2 Midian - Moses' wife is a descendant of Midian. Exodus 3:1
<li> 25:3 Sheba and Dedan, and the Merchants of Tarshish (Britain) 
	protest the attack of Gog on Israel.  Ezekiel 38:13
<li> 25:5 Isaac, as a type of Christ, inherits everything as an only son.
<li> 25:6 The others sons are given gifts, and sent to the "east country",
	especially Arabia.
<li> 25:10 Abraham is buried next to Sarah.
<li> 25:11 "Beer-lahai-roi" - well of living water.  In John 4, Jesus offers
	a woman living water, springing up into everlasting life.
<li> 25:13 Kedar - Psalm 120:5
<li> 25:16 The sons of Ishmael were 12 princes as promised.  Ishmael's
	descendants are also listed in 1 Chronicles 1.
<li> 25:21 Rebecca also was barren.  But instead of taking a concubine,
	Isaac and Rebecca intreat the Lord.
</ol>

<h4> Jacob and Esau </h4>

<ol>
<li> 25:22 "If it be so", Rebecca is acutely aware of the significance 
	of God's promise to Isaac.  If all the nations of the world
	will be blessed through her offspring, why are they fighting
	in the womb?  "The elder shall serve the younger." Genesis 48:19
<li> 25:25 Esau means "hairy".
<li> 25:26 Jacob means "grasper" or "supplanter"
<li> 25:27 "cunning hunter" - the same word used of Nimrod.  Genesis 10:9
	"man of the field" - through scripture the "field" is a type
	of the world.<br>
	"plain man" - the same word used of Job.  Job 1:8;2:3.
<li> 25:28 Trouble brews.  Esau ignores God's explicit word to Rebecca.
<li> 25:30 "red <i>pottage</i>" literally "red" or "red stuff".  The
	word "pottage" or "lentils" is inserted by the translators.  Esau
	sold his birthright for something he didn't know the name of.
	"Edom" means red.
<li> 25:34 "Esau despised his birthright."  Hebrews 12:16-17
</ol>
