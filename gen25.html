<h3> Genesis 20 </h3>

<ul>
<li> 20:6 "I withheld thee from sinning against Me."  This is a strong
	counterexample to the error of imagining God as helpless against
	the power of Man's free will.
<li> 20:7 Abimelech (quite understandably) sees only a liar and a deceiver, but
  God sees a just man.  "He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he
  seen perverseness in Israel."  Numbers 23:21
<li> 20:11 "I thought, surely the fear of God is not in this place" - and
	yet, both the king of Egypt and the king of the Phillistines 
	feared God much more that Abraham thought.
<li> 20:13 This besetting sin had its origin in Ur of the Chaldees, and
	had not been repented of.  It was still lying dormant, waiting
	for circumstances to trigger it again.  This time Abraham confesses his
	sin to Abimelech.  Until this sin had been confessed and forsaken,
	Abraham was not ready for Isaac.
<li> 20:15 Perhaps because Abraham made a full and sincere confession,
	Abimelech does not tell him to "get lost", as had the king
	of Egypt.

<h3> Leaving </h3>

<h4> As a new beginning </h4>

	to his wife."
<p>
Genesis 12:1 "Leave your country, your kindred, and your father's house."
<p>
Genesis 19:15 "Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here;
lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city."
<p>

petition which I asked of him:  Therefore also I have lent him to the Lord;
as long as he liveth he shall be lent to the Lord."
<p>
Isaiah 52:11,12 "Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean
thing; go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the
Lord.  For ye shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight: for the Lord
will go before you; and the God of Israel will be your rearward."
<p>
Matthew 19:28,29 â€œTruly I tell you, in the renewal of all things, when the Son
of Man sits on His glorious throne, you who have followed Me will also sit on
twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. And everyone who has
left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or
fields for the sake of My name will receive a hundredfold and will inherit
eternal life."

<h4> As punishment </h4>

<p>

fury and in great wrath, and cast them into another land, as it is this day."
<p>

<p>

<p>
Matthew 7:23 "Depart from me you workers of lawlessness."
<p>
Revelation 12:9 "So the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called
the Devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world."

<h4> As disobedience </h4>

grievous in the land."
<p>
Genesis 16:6 "And when Sarai dealt hardly with her, she fled from her face."

Lord."
