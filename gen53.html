<h3> Genesis 46 </h3>

<ul>
<li> 46:3 "make of thee a great nation" - Egypt will nurture the growth
	of Israel from 70 men and single women of his loins to 600000 
	men in Exodus 12:37.
<li> 46:11 Kohath is the grandfather of Moses.  There were at least 2 
	more generations before the Exodus, giving 6 generations in all,
	increasing by a factor averaging 9.2 each generation:
	9.2⁶ ~= 600000.
<li> 46:21 Benjamin gave his ten sons names which referred to the loss of his
	brother. Belah, because Joseph had disappeared ("swallow"); Becher,
	because Joseph was his mother's first-born; Ashbel, because Joseph was
	made a captive ("capture"); Gera, because he lived in a foreign land;
	Naaman, on account of Joseph's graceful speech ("grace"); Eḥi ("my only
	full brother"); Rosh ("the older"); Muppim, because Joseph taught
	Benjamin the things he himself had learned from his father ("double
	mouth"); Ḥuppim, "whose wedding I have not seen"; Ard, because Joseph
	was like a rose.
<li> 46:23 Son of Dan is Shuham elsewhere.  Hushim sounds like "What's their
	names".  Revelation 7:5-8  Dan is missing, replaced by
	Manasseh.  Genesis 49:17 Dan is a serpent.  Deuteronomy 33:22 Dan is a
	lion's whelp whereas Judah is a lion.  All this suggests that
	the antichrist will come from Dan.
<li> 46:27 Note that Leah is the only remaining wife of Jacob.  Her
	competition is gone, and she has Jacob all to herself in their
	old age.
