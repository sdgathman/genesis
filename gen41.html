<h3> Genesis 36 Esau's Extended Family </h3> 

Much of this is repeated in 1 Chronicles 1:35-54

<ul>
<li> 36:1 Ishmael and Esau put their "generations" statement at the beginning
	of the document, instead of the end, which is the Egyptian convention.
<li> 36:3 Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebahoth.  This 
	<a
	href="https://coatofmanycolors.net/2013/07/20/ishmaels-daughters-and-the-riddle-of-esaus-wives/">seems
	to conflict</a> with 26:34 which says Esau took Judith daughter of
	Beeri and Bashemath daughter of Elon.  Also 28:9 says Esau took
	Mahalath, Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebahoth.  This could mean
	that Esau married six wives, including two pairs of sisters,
	and two of his wives had the same name.  It could also mean he
	had four wives, by four fathers in law, and two of the wives
	had alternate names.  The Jewish commentators favor a 3 wife
	theory - making Judith and Oholibamah the same person, and
	explaining the two different fathers and two different tribes
	by making Judith the offspring of her Hivite mother and grandfather,
	with an adopted Horite father and new name.
<li> 36:6 Esau had already conquered Seir and was already living there 
	when Jacob returned to Caanan.  He now moves everything there.
<li> 36:9 The Second Generation is born in Seir.
<li> 36:11 Teman  Obadiah 1:9  Job 2:11
<li> 36:12 Amalek's descendents fight against Israel in Exodus 17:8-16.
	Baalam Prophesies their doom in Numbers 24:20.
	Saul's mission to annihilate the Amalekites is in 1 Samuel 15.
<li> 36:15 Kenaz - Numbers 24:21-22 prophesies the future of the Kenites.
<li> 36:20 Now the geneaology of Esau's in-laws, which begins before Esau.
	Deuteronomy 2:22 says God "Destroyed the Horites from before the
	children of Esau." 
<li> 36:28 Uz	Job 1:1 according to Jewish tradition.  This would imply Job
	lived double a normal lifespan for the time, otherwise his lifespan
	would place him as a contemporary of Reu.
<li> 36:31 Edom seems to have had kings (מְּלָכִ֔ים), and dukes/chiefs (אַלּוּפֵ֧י)
	under the kings, or the chiefs were earlier.
<li> 36:33 Esau's grandson is the second king listed.
<li> 36:40,41 The chiefs of Esau's line.  Are Timnah and Aholibamah
	women?
<li> 37:2 "These are the generations of Jacob" the end of Jacob's account.
	Joseph's account begins with the next sentence.
</ul>

The final judgement on Edom is for participating in the Babylonian captivity.
"Remember, O LORD, against the Edomites the day of Jerusalem’s fall, how they said, “Tear ["Raze it" NASB] it down! Tear it down! Down to its foundations!”" (Psalm 137:7)
