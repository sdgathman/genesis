<h4> Isaac the Man </h4>

In this chapter, we see Isaac encounter tests eirily similar to what
Abraham encountered, doing better on some, worse on others.  His
personality is contrasted with Abraham's with just a few masterful strokes
of the stylus.  These scenes set the stage for the sad events of the
next chapter.

<ol>
<li> 26:1 Having done better than his father on the first test, we
	move on to Isaac's second test.
<li> 26:2 Unlike Abraham, Isaac never left Caanan.  In the same way,
	Jesus will never leave Caanan - until He returns to His Father
	and then comes again to judge the living and the dead.
<li> 26:5 Ultimately, Isaac fails to follow God's instruction
	when he attempts to make Esau the child of Promise.
	Isaac has free will, but God's purpose will be accomplished.
<li> 26:6 Isaac likes living in civilization, instead of a tent.
<li> 26:7 But just like with Abraham, the worldly civilization 
	erodes Isaac's trust in God's promises.
<li> 26:8 And just like with Abraham, Isaac is found out.  I wonder if
	this Abimelech (a title meaning "king father") "just happened"
	to be looking out a window, or if he knew what happened
	with Abraham and was suspicious. 
<li> 26:9 At least Isaac tells the truth, like Abraham did the second time.
<li> 26:16 Whereas the former Abimelech saw God's blessing on Abraham
	and wanted to keep him around, this Abimelech sees God's blessing
	on Isaac and feels threatened by it.
<li> 26:20-22 Unlike Abraham, Isaac seeks to avoid conflict.
<li> 26:28 Now that Isaac is finally separated from the world, this
	Abimelech, like his predecessor, sees the light.
<li> 26:33 We now have several wells and a city named Beersheba.
<li> 26:34 Esau again demonstates his disdain for God's promises
	and covenant - making the Isaac's disobedience next time
	all the more egregious.
<li> 26:35 They were vexed in their righteous souls, but only Rebecca
	remembers God's choice of the heir - and like Sarah, she
	takes matters into her own hands.
