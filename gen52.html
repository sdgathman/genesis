<h3> Genesis 45,46 </h3>

In addition to foreshadowing Israel's future diaspora, Joseph is a picture
of the Christian's reconciliation to God.

<ul>
<li> 45:1 The moment his brothers confess their sin, Joseph makes himself
	known with no delay.  1 John 1:9  "Cause every man to go out from me" -
	there can be no other mediator between the repentant sinner and Christ.
<li> 45:2 Why did Joseph, who had such emotional regard for family, not contact
	Jacob after his rise to power?  
<li> 45:13 "And you shall tell ... of all my glory in Egypt and of all you have
	seen" - Matthew 28:18-20 the brothers are commissioned to tell of his
	glory, and bring all the family of Joseph into his presence.
<li> 45:15 "He kissed all his brethren" - Luke 15:20 The kiss signifies
	full forgiveness.
<li> 45:16 "It pleased Pharaoh well" - Luke 15:7,10,23 There is rejoicing in 
	heaven over one sinner that repents.
<li> 46:20 "Regard not your stuff, for the good of all the land of Egypt is
	yours" Luke 18:29-30
<li> 45:24 "And don't quarrel on the way!" - 2 Timothy 2:24 The servant of God
	must not quarrel.
<li> 45:26 At first, Jacob believed the lie, rather than the truth.
<li> 45:27-28 "the spirit of Jacob revived. Then Israel said" - Jacob
	gets filled with the Spirit!
<li> 46:1 Israel's immediately gives glory to God.
<li> 46:3 "Fear not to go to Egypt."  His inheritance is secure.
<li> 46:23 "Sons of Dan" - compare Numbers 26:42
<li> 46:27 "All the persons of the house of Jacob who went to Egypt were
	seventy" - compare Acts 7:14  "75 souls".  
</ul>
