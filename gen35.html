<h3> The Battle of the Brides </h3>

<h4> Genesis 29:31-30:24 </h4>

The names of the 12 tribes are given in great detail, as the mothers
prophecy over their children.
Let's look at two thing they point toward: the history of a believer, and
the history of the sons of Israel.

<h4> Leah's sons - the Egyptian bondage and deliverance (Exodus) </h4>

<ul>
<li> 29:32 Reuben - "Surely the Lord has looked on my affliction."
	Exodus 2:25,3:7 "I have surely seen the affliction of my people." 
<li> 29:33 Simeon - "Because the Lord has heard that I was hated."
	Exodus 3:7 "And have heard their cry."
<li> 29:34 Levi - "This time my husband will be joined to me."
	Jeremiah 31:32 "...the covenant that I made with their fathers in the
	day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of
	Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto
	them, saith the Lord."
<li> 29:35 Judah - "Now I will praise the Lord!"  Psalm 106:11,12 "Then they
	believed His words.  They sang his praise."
<li> 30:2 a point for Jacob - he recognizes who has closed Rachel's womb.
</ul>

<h4> Bilhah - the Wilderness Wanderings (Numbers) </h4>

<ul>
<li> 30:6 Dan - "God has judged me."  Psalm 106:13-33
<li> 30:8 Naphtali - "With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and
	I have prevailed."  Exodus 17:8-12  "When Moses held up his hand, Israel
	prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed."
</ul>

<h4> Zilpa and Leah - the Conquest of Caanan (Joshua) </h4>

<ul>
<li> 30:11 Gad - "A Troop cometh."  The hosts of the Caananites 
	oppose their conquest.
<li> 30:13 Asher - "Happy am I!"  The victory over their foes.
<li> 30:18 Issachar - "God has given me my hire."  The land is divided
	among the twelve tribes.
<li> 30:20 Zebulon - "God has given me a good dowry, now my husband will
	dwell with me."  Israel dwells in the land God had promised
	to Abraham, and God dwells in the Tabernacle.
<li> 30:21 Dinah - Judgement.  (Feminine of Dan.)
</ul>

<h4> Rachel - the Coming Messiah </h4>

<ul>
<li> 30:22 God hearkens to Rachel, who has apparently left off her own
	devices and turned to God.
<li> 30:24 Joseph - "The Lord will add to me another Son."  Much later,
	Rachel dies after giving birth to another son near Bethlehem,
	who she names "Son of my sorrow".  But his father renames him "Son of
	my right hand", and Rachel is buried in a tomb at Ramah.  
	Genesis 35:18-20
	<p>
	Many centuries later, Nebuchadnezzar will gather captives at Ramah,
	and take them all to Babylon.  The voice of Rachel weeping in
	the wilderness echoes through the centuries from her tomb and weeps
	over her children.  Jeremiah 31:15
	<p>
	Centuries later still, Israel will have another Son, who
	will be the Man of Sorrows. But His Father will say to Him,
	"Sit at my right hand."  At his birth, Herod will "hear news
	from the North and from the East and slaughter many."  Daniel 11:44
	And Rachel will weep again for her children through the centuries.
</ul>

<h4> The History of the Believer </h4>

<li> Simeon - Hearing.  Faith comes by hearing.  Romans 10:17
<li> Levi - Attached.  We are joined unto His Son.  1 Corinthians 6:17

	forever more.  Psalm 16:11
</ol>
