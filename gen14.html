<h3> The New World </h3>

<a href="http://biblehub.com/niv/genesis/9.htm">Genesis 9</a>
<p>
A new world emerges from the waters of the flood, reflecting the emergence
of Adam's world from the waters of the flood in 
<a href="http://biblehub.com/niv/genesis/1-2.htm">Genesis 1:2</a>.
<p>
We saw some ways that Noah was a type of Christ in 
<a href="http://biblehub.com/niv/genesis/6.htm">Genesis 6</a>.
In Genesis 9 we see many similarities to Adam, and thus how Noah, like Christ,
is a "second Adam".  

<ul>
<li> 9:1 "Be fruitful and multiply", as Adam was commanded in 
<a href="http://biblehub.com/niv/genesis/1-28.htm">1:28</a>.
<li> 9:2 Noah and his descendents given dominion over the animal world.
<li> 9:3 As the death of animals was required for Adam, so the life
of Noah and his descendents depends on eating animals (the only source
of essential vitamin B12).
<li> 9:5 The blood is sacred as in
<a href="http://biblehub.com/context/genesis/4-10.htm">4:10-11</a>,
<a href="http://biblehub.com/niv/genesis/37-22.htm">37:22</a>,
<a href="http://biblehub.com/niv/genesis/42-22.htm">42:22</a>,
<a href="http://biblehub.com/niv/genesis/49-11.htm">49:11</a>,
<a href="http://biblehub.com/niv/exodus/4-9.htm">Exodus 4:9</a>,
<a href="http://biblehub.com/niv/exodus/12-13.htm">Exodus 12:13</a>.
<li> 9:6 The institution of human government and capital punishment.  
<a href="http://biblehub.com/context/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1-2</a>
<li> 9:9 As the earth rising from the waters in
<a href="http://biblehub.com/niv/genesis/8.htm">Genesis 8</a> recapitulates
<a href="http://biblehub.com/niv/genesis/1-9.htm">1:9</a>,
so God makes his covenant with Noah, as with Adam, after a global flood.
<li> 9:10 The covenant applies to all who come out of the ark. They are "in
Noah", as we are "in Christ".
<li> 9:15 If you had any lingering doubts whether the text could possibly
somehow support a local flood, this eliminates them.  If the flood was local,
God is a liar - there have been many widespread and devasting floods since
this promise.
<li> 9:19 Like Adam, Noah had three sons.  With both, the line of Christ comes 
through the son whose genealogy is given third.
<li> 9:20 As Adam tended a garden, Noah tended a vineyard.
<li> 9:21 Like Adam, Noah sinned after receiving the covenant (involving
fruit), and his nakedness was revealed.
<li> 9:23 Like Adam, Noah's nakedness was covered.
<li> 9:25 See <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-21.htm">1 Kings 9:21</a>
and the Gibeonites in Joshua.  Caanan was not the father of "black people".
<li> 9:27 "Japheth" means "enlarge".  We will see in
<a href="http://biblehub.com/niv/genesis/10.htm">Genesis 10</a> that 
the descendents of Japheth occupy most of the worlds territory, including
Asia, Asia Minor, Europe, and probably America.
<li> 9:29 The reduction of lifespan did not affect Noah, but did affect his
	sons.
</ul>
