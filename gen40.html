<h3> Losses  - Genesis 35 </h3> 

<ul>
<li> 35:1 God reminded Jacob of his vow in 31:13, and God now again reminds
	Jacob of his vow from 28:20.
<li> 35:2 We now learn that like leaven, the Teraphim that Rachel stole,
	once the secret sin of Rachel, have now infected the entire family.
	"Behold a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump." Galatians 5:9
	Reeling from the disaster in Shechem, Jacob's conscience is 
	pricked, and he promptly acts to get rid of the leaven.  Exodus 12:15
	Note too how when Rachel says she cannot rise because she is unclean
	in 31:35, she really does sit upon an unclean thing hidden in
	the saddle bags.  Just as Lot's family was infected by the iniquity
	of Sodom, and Lot himself was on the verge of being consumed
	by the infection (19:15), this creeping evil was in part the source
	of the growing immorality and violence of Jacob's family that had just
	shown itself in Shechem.
<li> 35:4 The earrings go also - "and she decked herself with her earrings and
	her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgat me."   Hosea 2:13
<li> 35:5 "the terror of God" - this foreshadows not only the Conquest of
	Caanan, but the future return of Exiled Israel.
<li> 35:6,7 Abraham went to Egypt in unbelief, and returned in 13:3
<li> 35:9 Abraham's story picks up where it left off when he 
	returned to Bethel from Egypt in 13:3, the sojourn there in unbelief
	being so much lost time, and worse, carrying the seeds of sin and
	suffering that would come through Lot's greed and Sarai's employment of
	Hagar to "help" God out with his promise.  In the same way, Jacob's
	story resets after the decade in Shechem.
