<h3> Did Moses write Genesis?</h3>

There is much scholarly debate about this, based on frequency of words in
different sections.  The
<a href="https://creation.com/debunking-the-documentary-hypothesis">
Documentary Hypothesis</a> proposes that there were
4 sources, now lost to us, that were combined by an unknown editor around the
time of Ezra - painstakingly blended to create an "illusion of unity".
<p>
On a less imaginative front, there is excellent technical evidence that Moses
was the editor at least, and scholars debate whether God revealed the
entire Pentateuch to Moses via Divine Dictation, or acted as author and
editor as well.  If you are willing to believe Luke's account of
Jesus, we can skip all that: 
<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24.htm#27">Luke 24:27,44</a>
Genesis is the most quoted book in the Bible.  Jesus quotes both
creation accounts.  

<h4>Titles or Colophons?</h4>
There are 11 sections divided by the formula, "These are the generations
of ____", called תּוֹלְדֹת ("toledoth") meaning "generations" or "origin".
.  These are often interpreted as a heading or attribution for
the following section , with Genesis 1:1-2:3 as an introduction.  However, 
that formula was also how an author or owner signed clay tablets.  An
attribution referring to the preceding text is called "anaphoric".
Egyption documents on papyri, like New Testament epitles, introduce the
author at the beginning.  An attribution for the following text is called
"cataphoric". The account of Esau in
<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36.htm">Genesis 36</a> and the
account of Ishmael appear to be cataphoric, following the Egyptian
convention.
<p>
Moses as editor would have compiled all the tablets and papyri, including
their signatures.  The signature for the story of Joseph would be
<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1.htm">Exodus 1:1-5</a>.  
Charles V. Taylor takes the latter view in an
<a href="http://creation.com/who-wrote-genesis-are-the-toledoth-colophons">
excellent article</a>, and here is an 
<a href="http://bethyada.blogspot.com/2010/11/genesis-and-toledoth-theory.html">
opposing view</a>.

Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me.  Look for Jesus in
Genesis.

<h3> Alphabet and Simple Grammar</h3>

Ignoring the controversy over the paleo-hebrew alphabet, and when it was
used, we will use the Aramaic font that Daniel used, because he is our hero!

<h3><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-1.htm">Genesis 1:1</a></h3>

David wrote 
<a href="https://gathman.org/blog/2023/11/cosmic-take-down/">Psalm 8</a>
about Genesis.

<ul>
<li>1:1
  <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1</a> is the third
  genealogy of Christ, who was in the beginning.<br>
  בְּרֵאשִׁ֖ית "In beginning" Notice there is no definite article.  The beginning of
  our universe is not the beginning of everything.  The Bible describes a
  multi-verse.  Notice that there is nothing about this beginning that can be
  dated from the text.  When were the Angels created?  
  <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38.htm">Job 38</a> <br>
  בָּרָ֣א  "created from nothing," as distinct from יַּ֣עַשׂ (made)
  in verse 7.  The Bible multi-verse is very different from 
  modern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiverse">multiverse</a>
  cosmology.  Our universe is a story.  His Story.  There was no pre-existent
  hyper-universe, only the Author.  It is very different from
  <a href="http://bertie.ccsu.edu/naturesci/Cosmology/Cosmo1Background.html">
  Greek cosmology</a>, where the Demiurge <i>made</i> an island of order from
  pre-existing Chaos, protected by the celestial sphere.<br>
  אֱלֹהִ֑ים "Elohim," God.  Notice the masculine plural.  The
  singular would be Alah, from the verb "to fear" or "he sware".<br>
