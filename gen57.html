<h3> Genesis 49 </h3>

<h4> More on Zebulun </h4>

All the "bible maps" I could find of the territory of Zebulun show them as not
touching the Sea of Galilea or the Mediterranean.  However Josephus
(Antiquities V 1.22) describes them as stretching from Galilea to the
Carmel on the Mediterranean.  The east and west borders in Joshua 19 are
unclear in particulars, mentioning cities unidentified to us today, but
scholars agree that they are clear in general: Zebulun received a landlocked
estate from Joshua.
<p>
So, Jacob's prophecy was *not* fulfilled at the first inheritance of the land,
but was by the time of Christ: Matthew 4:12-16.  Furthermore, this "problem"
blows theories about a late authorship of Genesis out of the water. 
<p>
Other commentators note that Isaiah and Matthew mention Zebulun and Naphthali 
together - so that they shared the coastal territory (with a similar
arrangement with Asher as hinted by Deuteronomy 33:19).
