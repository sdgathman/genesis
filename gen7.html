<h3>Literal Interpretations</h3>

<ul>
<li> 2:5-6 No rain - watered by a mist.  A lost world, that was profoundly
	different from ours.
<li> 2:10-14 The world which was, perished. 2 Peter 3:6  The rivers would have
	been changed by the flood, so locating Eden is somewhat hopeless.
	Nevertheless, the Tigris and Euphrates have their source in the
	mountains of Armenia near mountain lakes, and there was a Cush
	on the shore of the Caspian, and Asshur embraced northern
	Mesopotamia. <p>
	Also, there are 4 river beds under sand in North Africa
	that match the description, and the post flood rivers would
	have been named after the memory of the now vanished rivers.
<li> 2:11-14  We switch from past to present - hinting that this narrative
	was written before the flood.  But Genesis 10:11 mentions Asshur.
	Was Asshur named after something from before the flood?
	Or was the narative composed after the flood (e.g. by Moses)?
<li> 2:14	Tigris and Euphrates
<li> 2:16 eating, you shall eat
<li> 2:17 dying, you shall die
<li> 2:19 This is an elaboration of 1:25. See 2 Kings 6-7 for a similar 
	narrative.
<li> 2:21 "rib" or "side" (of a pair).  Consider that taking the X side of
	the XY chromosome pair would produce a woman.
</ul>
