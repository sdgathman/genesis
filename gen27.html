<h4> Ishmael as a type of Israel </h4>

<ol>
<li> Ishmael was birthed by Hagar the Egyptian, and the nation of Israel
	was birthed in Egypt.
<li> Ishmael was Abraham's seed according to the flesh. Galatians 4:23
	Israel was Abraham's seed according to the flesh.  Romans 4:1
<li> Ishmael was cast out after rejecting the child of promise.  Israel
	was cast out of the Land after rejecting the Child of Promise.
<li> As the water was used up, so the Holy Spirit was withdrawn from Israel
	Ezekiel 11:22-23 - concerning which Eusebius writes in <a
	href="http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/eusebius_de_08_book6.htm">
	Demonstratio Evangelica, Book VI, Chapter 18</a> "Which it is possible
	for us to see literally fulfilled in another way even to-day, since
	believers in Christ all congregate from all parts of the world, not as
	of old time because of the glory of Jerusalem, nor that they may
	worship in the ancient Temple at Jerusalem, but they rest there that
	they may learn both about the city being taken and devastated as the
	prophets foretold, and that they may worship at the Mount of Olives
	opposite to the city, whither the glory of the Lord migrated when it
	left the former city." 
<li> When Ishmael cried out to God, God provided water.  When Israel
	mourns for him whom they have pierced and says "Blessed is he who comes
	in the name of the Lord" (Matthew 23:35) - then the Holy Spirit will
	be restored to Israel.  Zechariah 12:10
<li> As Ishmael took a wife from Egypt, so in the Last Days, Israel
	will ally with Egypt.  Isaiah 19:22-25
<li> As Ishmael begats twelve princes, so the twelve tribes of Israel
	will be restored in the millenium.
<li> As Ishmael dwelt in Paran - which in Hebrew is "beautiful" or "glorious",
	so Israel will dwell in the promised Land, restored from the
	curse on the ground.
</ol> 

<h3> Genesis 22 </h3>

"God tested Abraham" - the culmination of all the testing in previous chapters.
Here God reveals that while no Son of Adam will do, ultimately a human
sacrifice is required for human sin.

<h4> Isaac as a type of Christ </h4>

<ul>
<li>22:2 "thine only son" - God gave his only begotten son.  John 3:16
	God spared not his own son.  Romans 8:32
<li>22:3 "rose early in the morning" - Abraham has learned to obey
	quickly, and this also suggests Christ "slain before the foundation
	of the world". (1 Peter 1:20, Revelation 13:8)
<li>22:4 "and saw the place afar off" - "Your father Abraham rejoiced
	to see my day." John 8:56
	"on the third day" - Abraham receives Isaac from the dead 
	in a figure on the third day.  Hebrews 11:19  Christ
	rose from the dead on the third day.
<li>22:5 "the lad" - the same word used of a young man old enough for war.
	I.e.  not a child, but a young man who could have easily resisted his
	father.  Yet he meekly submitted to the will of his father.  He is 36
	at the death of Sarah.  He was likely around 32 or 33 here.
	"And come again together" - God had promised descendents as
	the stars through Isaac, so Abraham knew that God would have to raise
	Isaac from the dead. Hebrews 11:17-19
<li>22:6 "and they went together" - implies agreement, as in "Let us exalt his
	name together."  Psalm 34:4  Christ was in agreement with
	the Father.
<li>22:7 Isaac questions what must be done.  Christ questions the necessity
	of what must be done.  "If it be possible, take this cup from me."
<li>22:8 But they are still in agreement - "not my will, but thine be done."
<li>22:9 Isaac was laid upon the wood, as was Christ upon the cross.
<li>22:14 "The mount of the Lord" - in case you had any doubt this was 
	the very mount on which Christ was crucified.
</ul>
