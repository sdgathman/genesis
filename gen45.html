<li> 40:8 "Do not interpretation belong to God?" - "For I have not spoken of
	Myself; but the Father which sent Me, He gave Me a commandment, what I
	should say, and what I should speak." John 12:49.
<li> 40:13 "deliver Pharaohâ€™s cup into his hand" - the butler was also the
	official wine taster to prevent poisoning Pharaoh.

	works of the flesh.
