<h3> Genesis 13 </h3>

<h4> The Testing of Lot </h4>

<ul> 13:2 The riches acquired in Egypt will "pierce through with many sorrows"
- 1 Timothy 6:10 (as will the handmaiden, Hagar).
<li> 13:3 "went on his journeys" - retraced his steps, back to where he started, "where his tent had been at the beginning."
<li> 13:4 "the altar which he had made there at first" - emphasizing that the
sojourn in Egypt was a total loss.
<li> 13:7 Unbelievers observed the strife between believers.
<li> 13:10 "lifted up his eyes" - as in Genesis 3, the eyes are a key gate
	of temptation.  3:6, Joshua 7:21, 1 John 2:16
	"like the land of Egypt" - Lot is still longing for 
	Egypt.
<li> 13:13 "sinners before the LORD" - in God's face, as with Nimrod.
<li> 13:14 After Abram takes another step to fully obey God's instruction,
	God again gives him more light.  
<li> 13:17 God gives Abram a vision 
<li> 13:18 "Mamre" - vision or fatness.  Hebron - fellowship.  Fellowship
	is first mentioned when Abram fully obeys.
</ul>
