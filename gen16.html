<h3> Genesis 11 </h3>

<h4> The First Antichrist </h4>

<ul>
<li> 11:1-2 Chapter 9 closes with Noah's children and grandchildren as the sole
remnants of humanity.  God's instruction was to "multiply and fill the earth"
(9:1).  They multiplied with gusto, but balked at leaving home to fill the
earth.  
<li> 10:8 "Nimrod" means "rebel". 2 Thessalonians 2:8.  "Began to be a mighty
one in the earth", Nimrod is mighty.  2 Thessalonians 2:9
<li> 10:9 "mighty hunter before the Lord", compare "the earth was corrupt
before the Lord".  
<li> 10:10 Nimrod became the leader of the entire world - a type
of the antichrist to come.  He was king in Babylon - as will be the
Man of Sin.  Isaiah 14 (sees both historical Babylon, and Lucifer and the 
antichrist).  Revelation 17:5
<li> 11:3-4 Under Nimrod's leadership, the clan does the opposite of God's
instruction - as the antichrist leads the whole world in open rebellion
against God.  "Let us make us a name" - pride is what drives Lucifer, and
is what drives Nimrod and the antichrist to lead the people to rebel against
God.  2 Thessalonians 2:4  "Reach unto heaven" - "Babel" literally means
"gate of God", but after the events to follow, it will forever after mean
"confusion".  The first Babylon establishes an idolatrous world religion, as
will Babylon in Daniel and Revelation.
<li> 11:8 As God intervened to disrupt the one world religion and government
of the first Babylon, so he intervenes to stop a similar outcome
in Daniel - and in Revelation.
<p>
Peleg was named after the dividing of the earth, and as Nimrod was 
a contemporary of Salah, this could refer to the dispersal from the tower
of Babel.  Alternatively, as suggested in Job, the continents were dividing
in his day.  In either case (or both), the aftershocks of the cataclysm that
caused the great flood were striking everywhere - and it was crucial that the
rapidly growing clan of survivors not remain in one place.
<p>
The Hungarian myth of national origin traces their lineage back to Nimrod
(who casts himself on a burning altar after his kingdom is dispersed),
and has Nimrod's sons Hunar and Magya and their families actually transported
to the far east from Shinar.  Whether driven apart by language, or teleported,
or both, the people were scattered over the entire earth.
</ul>

<h4> The Birth of a Nation </h4>

<ul>
<li> 11:10-26 This handy dated genealogy lets us make a timeline 
the events of Genesis through Isaac. See <a href="shem.html">Abram</a>
for an alternative (traditional Jewish) interpration that has Abram born 60
years earlier, 1948 years after the first Adam was created to birth
the Jewish nation.  1948 years after the second Adam was created (and born),
a Jewish state was created.

</pre>
<li> 11:28 Ur of the Chaldees - the ancestors of the rulers of Babylon
in Daniels time - where the descendents of Jacob are sent back to
for their disobedience.
<li> 11:29-30 Abram gets married, but Sarai is barren.  This was
possibly an attack of Satan, since God spoke to Abram revealing that he is the
chosen line of <a href="http://gathman.org/genesis/seed1.html">the Seed</a>.
Acts 7:1-4
<li> 11:31 God told Abram to leave his country and kindred,
but Abram stops in Haran, and fails to leave his father.
<li> 11:32 Despite God's command to "leave your country and your father's
house" in 12:1, Abram stays in Haran until his father dies.  Abram is
now age 75.
