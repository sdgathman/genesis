<h3> Genesis 50 </h3>

<ul>
<li> 50:3 "the Egyptians mourned for him 70 days" - this was the formal 
	mourning period for a royal, as it was the time required for
	<a href="http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/funerary_practices/embalmers.htm">mummification</a>.
<li> 50:15 "perhaps Joseph will hate us" - not an unreasonable fear given human
	nature.  "all the evil which we did to him" - they recognized their
	own sin, and feared justice.
<li> 50:16 "before your father died, he commanded" - a rather unlikely tale.
	They didn't feel worthy to just ask for mercy.
<li> 50:17 "Joseph wept" - that they were lying, and doubted his forgiveness.
<li> 50:19 "Am I in the place of God?" - "Vengence is mine, saith the Lord" 
	<a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/12-19.htm">Romans 12:19</a>
<li> 50:20 "you meant it for evil" - Joseph does not romanticize the evil
	done.  "God meant it for good" 
	<a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-28.htm">Romans 8:28</a>
<li> 50:24 "God will surely bring you up out of Egypt" 
	<a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-22.htm">Hebrews 11:22</a>
<li> 50:25 According to this and Hebrews 11:22, Joseph was not buried until 
	they buried him in Schechem after the Exodus.  
	<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/13-19.htm">Exodus 13:19</a>,
	<a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-32.htm">Joshua 24:32</a>
<li> 50:26 "a coffin in Egypt" - His coffin laid aboveground for the 100 or so
	years until it was taken back to Canaan. It was a silent witness for
	all those years that Israel was going back to the Promised Land, just
	as God said.
</ul>

The generally accepted site of Joseph's tomb is on the West Bank in Nablus.
It was handed over to the Palestinian Authority as part of the Oslo Accords,
with the requirement of free access to people of faith.  
Presumably, the grave would contain an Egyptian mummy - but violence between
Israelis and Palestinians has prevented access.
