<h3> Genesis 48,49 </h3>

<h4> The Death of Jacob </h4>

<ul>
<li> 48:10,11 Israel physical eyes were dim, but God showed him Joseph's
	seed.
<li> 48:14 Israel crosses his arms, seeing with spiritual eyes.
<li> 48:16 "let my name be upon them" - Israel adopts Ephraim and Mannasseh.
<li> 48:19 "I know it" - Israel saw perfectly well through the eyes of faith.
	Unlike earlier times, Israel was in charge and walking by the Spirit.
	Hebrews 11:21
<li> 48:22 "one portion more" - Shechem Joshua 24:32 and John 4:5, but
	also a double portion by Israel adoption Ephraim and Mannasseh.
<li> 49:1 "what shall befall you in the last days" - prophecy follows.
	See Deuteronomy 33
<li> 49:2 "sons of Jacob", "Israel your Father" - again with the two
	names.  Israel was walking in the Spirit, his sons in the flesh.
<li> 49:4 "thou shalt not excel" - no prophets, no kings, no judges.  
	Reubens numbers decrease between the two numberings in Numbers.
	Reuben doesn't even take an inheritance in the land.  
	"unstable as water" - unreliable, like streams that spring up
	in the desert and then disappear.
	"father's bed" - Reuben tried to take his fathers place
	prematurely.  Who does that remind you of?
<li> 49:7 "divide in Jacob" - Joshua 19, "scatter in Israel" Joshua 18:7, 
	Joshua 21
</ul>
