<h4> Genesis 27: The Mantel of the First Born </h4>

All four players did wrong.  Esau marries foreign wives (and earlier sold
his birthright for "red".) Isaac tries to make Esau the heir.  Rebecca
tries to "help" God out.  Jacob grabs the blessing from Esau by deceit.
But, in the midst of this mess, there are wonderful types.  
Jacob is a type of the believer, he is considered a "plain" ("just") 
man despite his trickery.  On one hand Esau is a type of the unbeliever, but on
another view Esau is a type of Christ as the Elder brother.

<ul>
<li> 26:34 By marrying not one, but two caananite wives, Esau puts to rest any
     hopes that he might have reconsidered his disinterest in the birthright
     and the promises that go with it.
<li> 27:1 Isaac could not see well - spiritually as well as physically.
<li> 27:4 Isaac insists on making Esau the heir, despite God's word
	to Rebecca and Esau taking 2 forbidden Caananite wives.
<li> 27:10 Rebecca remembers God's word at the twin's birth, and decides
	that God needs some help.
<li> 27:12 Jacob is not concerned with the ethics of the scheme - only with
	getting caught.
<li> 27:13 The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_orders">
	Nuremberg Defense</a>. Following orders is no excuse for doing evil.
	Compare Matthew 27:25 where the leaders of Israel tell Pilate, "His 
	blood be on us and on our children."  Rebecca does suffer a curse,
	as do the leaders of Israel and their children.
<li> 27:15 Jacob is clothed with the garments of Esau as we are clothed
	with the righteousness of Christ. "But be clothed with the Lord Jesus
	Christ." Romans 13:14 Galations 3:27
<li> 27:24 As we are in Christ, when God looks upon us, He sees His Son.
<li> 27:27 "For we are the aroma of Christ to God..." 2 Corinthians 2:15
<li> 27:33 Isaac suddenly realizes that what God spoke to Rebecca has
	come to pass - despite Isaac's direct defiance.  That is a
	terrifying realization. 
<li> 27:40 "By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come."
	Hebrews 11:20.  Edom throws off the yoke of Israel in 2 Kings 8:20.
<li> 27:44-45 Rebecca never sees Jacob again before she dies 20 years later,
	and is in fact deprived of them both in one day as Esau hates her for
	depriving him of his blessing.  She is buried in secret as
	Isaac is blind, Jacob is absent, and Esau is estranged.
