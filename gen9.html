<h2>The Second Murder </h2>

Genesis 4 

<h3> Pharisee and Publican</h3>

Cain is the model of all those who would attempt to cover their sin
by their own efforts, what Jude calls the "Way of Cain" (v11).
Abel is the model of those who by faith appropriate God's provision of 
a sacrifice for sin.

<ul>
<li> 4:3 "in the course of time" - an appointed time and an appointed place
"between the cherubim".  
<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/25-22.htm">Exodus 25:22</a>,
<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-16.htm">Isaiah 37:16</a>
Cain's offering was no more effective than the fig leaves.  
<li> 4:4 "fat thereof" A burnt offering, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-16.htm">Leviticus 3:16</a>
The two sons had been instructed in the Levitical service, for "faith comes by
hearing".  <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-17.htm">Romans 10:17</a> God
accepted the offering by fire from heaven.
<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-24.htm">Leviticus 9:24</a>,
<a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-4.htm">Hebrews 11:4</a> Abel stands for
all those who receive the Lamb of God as their substitute.
<p>
The new covenant: "Present your bodies a living sacrifice." <a
href="http://biblehub.com/romans/12.htm"> 
<a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/2.htm">Acts 2</a>: fire from heaven.
<li> 4:5 The problem was the sacrifice, Hebrews 11:4  Abel was no more
righteous than Cain.  The angel at passover passed over according to blood on
the doorpost, not race.
<li> 4:6-8 Echoes of Genesis 3.  Lust/anger leads to sin leads to death.
<a href="http://biblehub.com/james/1-15.htm">James 1:15</a>  "Rule over him/it"  There is no neuter in Hebrew. Cain
was to rule over Abel.
<li> 4:12 God's discipline takes away Cain's very point of pride.
<li> 4:13 "punishment" - actually, "iniquity".  Cain finally admits guilt.
<li> 4:17 "Enoch" - "dedication".  A new beginning for Cain.
<li> 4:18 Note names ending in "-el".  Methusael means "Man of God".  There was
apparently redemption for Cain.
<li> 4:20-22 An advanced civilization from the very beginning.
<li> 4:23 Lamech was likely armed with an iron weapon thanks to his son Tubal-cain.
<li> 4:24 God's protection of Cain was well known.  "Seventy times seven"
<a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/18-22.htm">Matthew 18:22</a>
<li> 4:25 The Seed is still coming.
"Enosh" - man.  Then began men to call upon the name of the Lord.  When
Bar-enosh, the Son of Man, came men also begain to call upon the name
of the Lord.
</ul>

<h3> Cain, Abel, Israel and Christ</h3>

law <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-3.htm">Romans 10:3</a>
