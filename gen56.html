<h3> Genesis 49 </h3>

<h4>Judges of Israel</h4>

I thought it might be interesting to find the tribe of each of the judges.
<pre>
Joshua  Ephraim
Caleb, Othniel	Judah 
Ehud	Benjamin
Shamgar	Hittite ruler
Deborah Ephraim
Barak	Naphtali
Gideon	Manasseh 
Abimelech Manasseh (evil ruler)
Tolah	Issachar
Jair	Judah + Manasseh (through his wife Abijah)
Jephthah Manasseh (illegitimate)
Ibzan	Zebulun (Bethlehem by the Sea) or Judah (Bethlehem of Judah)
Elon	Zebulun
Abdon	Ephraim
Sampson	Dan
</pre>

<h4> The Death of Jacob </h4>

<ul>
<li> 49:7 "divide in Jacob" - Joshua 19, "scatter in Israel" Joshua 18:7, 
	Joshua 21
<li> 49:8 Judah the Lion - "praise", "thy father's children shall bow" - Joseph
	received the birthright, but Judah receives the eternal kingship with
	David much later.  1 Chronicles 5:2
<li> 49:10 "the sceptre shall not depart from Judah until Shiloh come".  
  "Shiloh" means "the one who is worthy".  (Revelation 5)
  The sceptre is the power of capital punishment.  (See Esther 4:11)
<p>
  Herod Archelaeus causes too much bloodshed in his heavy handed rule
  (Wars of the Jews 2:8), so Rome banishes him to Gaul and makes Judeah
  a Roman province, appointing Caponius Procurator (around 7 A.D.):
<blockquote>
“But in the tenth year of Archelaus’ government, both his brethren, and the
principal men of Judea and Samaria, not being able to bear his barbarous and
tyrannical usage of them, accused him … Caesar, upon hearing what certain
accusers had to say… both banished him, and appointed Vienna, a city of Gaul,
to be the place of his habitation, and took his money away from him…Caponius
also, a man of the equestrian order, was sent…to have the supreme power over
the Jews” (Josephus, Antiquities, Book 17; chapter 13 verse 2 and Book 18;
chapter 1 verse 1).  </blockquote>

By that decree, the Sanhedrin was restricted and adjudication of capital
offenses was lost.  
The Jews went about mourning for they thought (but see Luke 2:42-52):
<blockquote>
"Woe unto us for the scepter has departed from Judah and the Messiah has not
come!" (Babylonian Talmud, chapter 4, folio 37).  </blockquote>

  Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law.
  The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to
  death: That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake,
  signifying what death he should die. John 19:31-32
<li> 49:11 	the wine district of Israel: 2 Chronicles 26:10, also
	Engedi.  "ass's colt to the choice vine" Zechariah 9:9
	- who is the Choice Vine?  John 12:13-15
	"clothes in the blood of grapes" Isaiah 63 (remember, Edom means
	"red"), Revelation 19:13
<li> 49:13 Zebulun - "dwelling", was in Galilea.  Jesus was born in Bethlehem
of Judah, but lived in Galilea.  All the disciples were from Galilea except for
Judas.  "Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out."   Deuteronomy 33:18  Jesus 
went out from Zebulun to proclaim the Kingdom of God.
<li> 49:14 Issachar, "an hire", the Ox.
</ul>
This concludes the 6 sons of Leah.
