Gen 49, the scepter shall not depart from Judah until Shiloh come: departed
when Jesus was a boy when Romans took away right of capital punishment.

Jacob
The law is a mirror, and shows us our need.  The mirror does not shave us,
we are shaved by grace.

Gen 32, Jacob meets Esau 
Conscience doth make cowards of us all.
