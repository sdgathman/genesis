<h2>The Second Murder </h2>

Genesis 4 

<h3> Pharisee and Publican</h3>

Cain is the model of all those who would attempt to cover their sin
by their own efforts, what Jude calls the "Way of Cain" (v11).
Abel is the model of those who by faith appropriate God's provision of 
a sacrifice for sin.

<ul>
<li> 4:3 "in the course of time" - an appointed time.  Cain's offering
was no more effective than the fig leaves.
<li> 4:4 "fat thereof" A burnt offering, Leviticus 3:16  
The two sons had been instructed in the Levitical service, for "faith
comes by hearing".  Rom 10:17 God accepted the
offering by fire from heaven.  Leviticus 9:24, Hebrews 11:4  Abel stands for
all those who receive the Lamb of God as their substitute.
<p>
The new covenant: "Present your bodies a living sacrifice."
Acts 2: fire from heaven.
<li> 4:5 The problem was the sacrifice, Hebrews 11:4  Abel was no more
righteous than Cain.  The angel at passover passed over according to blood on
the doorpost, not race.
<li> 4:6-8 Echoes of Genesis 3.  Lust/anger leads to sin leads to death.
James 1:15  "Rule over him/it"  There is no neuter in Hebrew. Cain
was to rule over Abel.
<li> 4:12 God's discipline takes away Cain's very point of pride.
<li> 4:13 "punishment" - actually, "iniquity".  Cain finally admits guilt.
<li> 4:17 "Enoch" - "dedication".  A new beginning for Cain.
<li> 4:18 Note names ending in "-el".  Methusael means "Man of God".  There was
apparently redemption for Cain.
<li> 4:20-22 An advanced civilization from the very beginning.
<li> 4:23 Lamech was likely armed with an iron weapon thanks to his son Tubal-cain.
<li> 4:24 God's protection of Cain was well known.  "Seventy times seven"
Matthew 18:22
<li> 4:25 The Seed is still coming.
"Enosh" - man.  Then began men to call upon the name of the Lord.  When
Bar-enosh, the Son of Man, came men also begain to call upon the name
of the Lord.
</ul>

<h3>  Israel and Christ</h3>

<ul>
<li> 4:2 Christ is our shepherd, Israel was the tiller of the land.
	Matthew 21:33-46
<li> 4:4 Christ presented Himself, a Lamb as the sacrifice.  Hebrews 10:12
Ephesian 5:2  The Jews rejected God's provision of a Lamb (John 1:11), and were
ignorant of God's righteousness and attempted to provide their own by obedience
to the law Romans 10:3
<li> 4:5 God did not accept the Jews offering of righteousness according
to the Law. Acts 13:39  Romans 9:31,32
Christ was hated by his brethren for no reason.
<li> 4:7 Israel was to be chief of the nations.  Deuteronomy 28:13
<li> 4:8 Israel killed Christ out of envy.  Matthew 27:18  
<li> 4:10 The blood of Christ speaks better things.  Hebrews 12:24
<li> 4:11 "His blood be upon us and upon our children."  Matthew 27:25
<li> 4:12 Israel's land was cursed with barreness.  Leviticus 26:34,35 Deuteronomy 28:15ff
<li> 4:13 Israel will admit their iniquity is greater than they can bear.
	Zechariah 12:10
<li> 4:14 Israel was driven out of the land by Rome, and lived as exiles.
God's face is hidden from them Hosea 1:9  The hand of most nations has
been against the Jew.  Deuteronomy 28:66
<li> 4:15 "He that touches Israel, touches the Apple of my eye".  Gen 12:3 Zech 2:8
<li> 4:17 After Christ, Israel dwelt primarily in Cities
</ul>
