<h3> The New World </h3>

Genesis 9
<p>
We saw some ways that Noah was a type of Christ in Genesis 6.  In Genesis 9
we see many similarities to Adam, and thus how Noah, like Christ, is a
"second Adam".  

<ul>
<li> 9:1 "Be fruitful and multiply", as Adam was commanded in 1:28
<li> 9:2 Noah and his descendents given dominion over the animal world.
<li> 9:3 As the death of animals was required for Adam, so the life
of Noah and his descendents depends on eating animals (the only source
of essential vitamin B12).
<li> 9:5 The blood is sacred as in 4:10-11, 37:22, 42:22, 49:11, Exodus 4:9,
Exodus 12:13.
<li> 9:6 The institution of human government and capital punishment.  Romans 13:1-2
<li> 9:9 As the earth rising from the waters in Genesis 8 recapitulates
1:9, so God makes his covenant with Noah, as with Adam, after a global flood.
<li> 9:10 The covenant applies to all who come out of the ark. They are "in
Noah", as we are "in Christ".
<li> 9:15 If you had any lingering doubts whether the text could possibly
somehow support a local flood, this eliminates them.  If the flood was local,
God is a liar - there have been many widespread and devasting floods since
this promise.
<li> 9:19 Like Adam, Noah had three sons.  With both, the line of Christ comes 
through the son whose genealogy is given third.
<li> 9:20 As Adam tended a garden, Noah tended a vineyard.
<li> 9:21 Like Adam, Noah sinned after receiving the covenant (involving
fruit), and his nakedness was revealed.
<li> 9:23 Like Adam, Noah's nakedness was covered.
<li> 9:25 See 1 Kings 9:21 and the Gibeonites in Joshua.  Caanan was
not the father of "black people".
<li> 9:27 "Japheth" means "enlarge".  We will see in Genesis 10 that 
the descendents of Japheth occupy most of the worlds territory, including
Asia, Asia Minor, Europe, and probably America.
<li> 9:29 The reduction of lifespan did not affect Noah, but did affect his
	sons.
</ul>
