<h3> Losses  - Genesis 35 </h3> 

<ul>
<li> 35:1 God reminded Jacob of his vow in 31:13, and God now again reminds
	Jacob of his vow from 28:20.
<li> 35:2 We now learn that like leaven, the Teraphim that Rachel stole,
	once the secret sin of Rachel, have now infected the entire family.
	"Behold a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump." Galatians 5:9
	Reeling from the disaster in Shechem, Jacob's conscience is 
	pricked, and he promptly acts to get rid of the leaven.  Exodus 12:15
	Note too how when Rachel says she cannot rise because she is unclean
	in 31:35, she really does sit upon an unclean thing hidden in
	the saddle bags.  Just as Lot's family was infected by the iniquity
	of Sodom, and Lot himself was on the verge of being consumed
	by the infection (19:15), this creeping evil was in part the source
	of the growing immorality and violence of Jacob's family that had just
	shown itself in Shechem.
<li> 35:4 The earrings also - "and she decked herself with her earrings and
	her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and forgat me."   Hosea 2:13
<li> 35:5 "the terror of God" - this foreshadows not only the Conquest of
	Caanan, but the future return of Exiled Israel.
<li> 35:6,7 Abraham went to Egypt in unbelief, and returned in 13:3
<li> 35:8 Deborah, from Laban's household dies, and is mourned and buried.
	It might imply that Rebecca is already dead as well.
<li> 35:9 Abraham's story picks up where it left off when he 
	returned to Bethel from Egypt in 13:3, the sojourn there in unbelief
	being so much lost time, and worse, carrying the seeds of sin and
	suffering that would come through Lot's greed and Sarai's employment of
	Hagar to "help" God out with his promise.  In the same way, Jacob's
	story resets after more than a decade in Shechem.
<li> 35:10 "thy name shall be Israel" - God says in effect "let's just pick up
	where you left" and just ignore that whole Shechem sojourn.
<li> 35:16 Coming from Bethel, with Bethlehem just in sight ahead is Rama.
	Rachel cries out in anguish, her cries echoing in the desolate hills
	and down through the centuries. Her husband has been told to return to
	his ancestral place, and her baby has chosen this inopportune moment to
	enter the world outside the womb. It is Anno Mundi 2240 (~1800BC), and
	there are no inns to turn them away.
	<p>
	As death approaches, she sees through time and weeps for her children.
	600 years later, 25000 of Benjamins descendents will be cut down,
	fleeing to the west through Rama.  Judges 20
	<p>
	Another 600 years, and she hears a voice proclaim: Thus says the LORD,
	"A voice is heard in Ramah, Lamentation and bitter weeping. Rachel is
	weeping for her children; She refuses to be comforted for her children,
	Because they are no more."  Soon, soldiers of Nebuchadnezzar gather the
	children of Israel at Rama to be deported to Babylon - Daniel
	among them.  Jeremiah 31:16
	<p>
	Another 600 years, and she hears another voice: "But rumors from the
	East and from the North will disturb him, and he will go forth with
	great wrath to destroy and annihilate many. "He will pitch the tents of
	his royal pavilion between the seas and the beautiful Holy Mountain;
	yet he will come to his end, and no one will help him. Daniel 11:45
	<p>
	Herod's soldiers march through Bethlehem just ahead, killing not
	warriors, but babies.  Mothers are screaming in anguish, and their
	screams seem to intensify Rachel's own anguish, and she cries out anew
	in despair. Matthew 2:17
<li> 35:17 She hears a voice hear at hand. It is the midwife saying, "Don’t
	despair, for you have another son!” Rachel names him Ben-Oni, "son of
	my sorrow", before the world fades away altogether.  
<li> 35:18 When the son is presented to his father Jacob, Jacob changes his
	name to Benjamin, "son of my right hand".  Eighteen centuries later,
	one toddler escapes Herod's soldiers by fleeing to Egypt. He will be
	called a Man of Sorrows, and his mother will also be pierced through
	with many sorrows. But after his anguish, his Father will say to
	him, "sit at my right hand".
<li> 35:22 Reuben's sin is mentioned before reiterating the 12 sons to 
	show how he forfeited his birthright along with Simeon and Levi.
<li> 35:27 Isaac's death happens 27 years after Jacob joins Joseph in Egypt.
	Isaac did not go to Egypt - an important point.  Joseph
	send wagons of supplies, so Isaac did not lack.  Jacob travels
	back to Caanan to bury his father, as Joseph did to bury Jacob
	in Genesis 50.

typical of the Future restoration of Israel.
