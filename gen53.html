<h3> Genesis 46 </h3>

<ul>
<li> 46:3 "make of thee a great nation" - Egypt will nurture the growth
	of Israel from 70 men and single women of his loins to 600000 
	men in Exodus 12:37.
<li> 46:11 Kohath is the grandfather of Moses.  There were at least 2 
	more generations before the Exodus, giving 6 generations in all,
	increasing by a factor averaging 9.2 each generation:
	9.2‚Å∂ ~= 600000.
<li> 46:23 Son of Dan is Shuham elsewhere.  Hushim sounds like "What's their
	names".  Revelation 7:5-8  Dan is missing, replaced by
	Manasseh.  Genesis 49:17 Dan is a serpent.  Deuteronomy 33:22 Dan is a
	lion's whelp whereas Judah is a lion.  All this suggests that
	the antichrist will come from Dan.
<li> 46:27 Note that Leah is the only remaining wife of Jacob.  Her
	competition is gone, and she has Jacob all to herself in their
	old age.
