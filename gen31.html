<h4> Isaac the Man </h4>

In this chapter, we see Isaac encounter tests eirily similar to what
Abraham encountered, doing better on some, worse on others.  His
personality is contrasted with Abraham's with just a few masterful strokes
of the stylus.  These scenes set the stage for the sad events of the
next chapter.  

<ul>
<li> 26:1 Having done better than his father on the first test, we
	move on to Isaac's second test.
<li> 26:2 Unlike Abraham, Isaac never left Caanan.  In the same way,
	Jesus will never leave Caanan - until He returns to His Father
	and then comes again to judge the living and the dead.
<li> 26:5 Ultimately, Isaac fails to follow God's instruction
	when he attempts to make Esau the child of Promise.
	Isaac has free will, but God's purpose will be accomplished.
<li> 26:6 Isaac likes living in civilization, instead of a tent,
	but he is no longer meditating daily at the well
	of living water.
<li> 26:7 Just like with Abraham, the worldly civilization 
	erodes Isaac's trust in God's promises, and he backslides.
<li> 26:8 And just like with Abraham, Isaac is found out.  I wonder if
	this Abimelech (a title meaning "king father") "just happened"
	to be looking out a window, or if he knew about Abraham.
<li> 26:9 At least Isaac tells the truth, like Abraham did the second time.
<li> 26:16 Whereas the former Abimelech saw God's blessing on Abraham
	and wanted to keep him around, this Abimelech sees God's blessing
	on Isaac and feels threatened by it.
<li> 26:18 Reopening wells that were stopped.  Isaac could be called
	the Man of the Wells.
<li> 26:20-22 Unlike Abraham, Isaac seeks to avoid conflict.
<li> 26:28 Now that Isaac is finally separated from the world, and again
	meditating by a well, this Abimelech, like his predecessor, sees the
	light.  We cannot be a light to the world while being conformed to
	the world.
<li> 26:33 We now have several wells and a city named Beersheba.
	Seven wells are mentioned, in fact.
<li> 26:34 Esau again demonstates his disdain for God's promises
	and covenant - making Isaac's disobedience in the next chapter
	all the more egregious.
<li> 26:35 They were vexed in their righteous souls, but only Rebecca
	remembers God's choice of the heir - and like Sarah, she
	takes matters into her own hands.
</ul>

<h4> How did Isaac do? </h4>

Rate Isaac's response to these tests of faith.  Hebrews 12:1

<ol>
<li> Rachel is barren
<li> Famine in Caanan
<li> Fear of death
<li> The lure of the world
<li> Violent conflict
<li> Respecting God's chosen heir (Genesis 27)
</ol>
