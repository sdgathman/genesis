<h3> Genesis 49,50 </h3>

<h4>Jacob's Prophecy - the Sons of Rachel </h4>

<ul>
<li> 49:22 "run over the wall" - Joshua!
<li> 49:24 "from thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel" - first mention
	of Christ as "the stone".  This implies that the Bethel Stone 
	had been brought to Egypt, was what Jacob leaned upon in 47:31,
	was in view of the brothers in this final blessing, and was given
	to Joseph as an inheritance.
</ul>

<h4> The History of the Shepherd Stone </h4>

with them from Egypt and on their wanderings, until it was restored
to Bethel.

<li> Genesis 47:31, Hebrews 11:12 
<li> Joshua 16 - the Bethel Stone is Joseph's inheritance.
<li> Exodus 17:6	"strike the rock"

<li> 2 Kings 11:14 "the king (Joash) stood by the pillar"
<li> 2 Kings 23:3 "the (Josiah) stood by the pillar"
</ul>

<h4> The Shepherd Stone as a type of Christ </h4>

<ul>
<li> Genesis 28:18 "and poured oil on the top of it" - Jacob anoints the stone
	making it the Anointed One among stones.
<li> Zechariah 13:7 "Smite the Shepherd and the sheep will scatter."
<li> Psalm 95:1 "Let us sing unto the Rock of our salvation"
<li> 1 Corinthians 10:4 "They drank from that spiritual Rock that followed
	them, and that Rock was Christ."
