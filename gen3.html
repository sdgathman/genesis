<h3>Vowel Points</h3>

In the 8th century AD, Hebrew literacy was dying out.  So Masoretic scribes
invented a system of indicating vowels without disturbing the sacred text.
Jerome knew nothing of vowel points, and Hebrew literacy was high at the
time of Christ and the Apostles.

<h2>The First Day: Light and Darkness</h2>

<h3> Figurative Meanings </h3>

<ul>
<li> 1:2 The souls of fallen men are falling into chaos.  "The Lord begins his
work upon man by the visitation of the Spirit, who enters the soul
mysteriously, and broods over it, even as of old he moved upon the face of the
waters."  Spurgeon: Sunday Morning, August 29, 1875

<li> 1:3 The Word of God is the true light that enlightens every man than comes
into the world. John 1:9  The light that shines from darkness - despite
no sun or moon, is a mysterious light.  God is the ultimate source of
all light.  James 1:17  
"There will be no need of the sun or moon." Revelation 21:23
<p> "And there will be no more night."  Revelation 22:5

<li> 1:4 God making light to shine out of darkness prefigures the light God
makes to shine from our hearts.  2 Cor 4:6  It is by the Word of God
that light came into the world, and by the Word of God that light comes
into our souls.  God was the sole observer of that light, and is the
sole observer of the true state of our souls.  The Lord sees whatever He
creates.  The carnal man cannot understand the True Light. John 1:5

</ul>

<h3>Literal Interpretations</h3>

"It is also frequently asked what our belief must be about the form and shape
of heaven according to Sacred Scripture.  Many scholars engage in lengthy
discussions on these matters, but the sacred writers with their deeper
wisdom have omitted them."  Augustine, Literal Meaning of Genesis, Book 2, Chapter 9.

<ul>
<li> 1:2 Gap Theory says earth *became* formless and void.  Jeremiah 4:23
Without Gap Theory, 1:1-2 is part of the first day.
<li> 1:3 God the Father God creates and speaks the Word.  God the Spirit moves
on the waters.  The Word of God makes all things.
<li> 1:5 The words for evening and morning also mean chaos and order.  Each
day is a reversal of entropy, progessing from formless and void to
ordered and good.  
</ul>
Synchrony (timing and order of events) in relativity can be defined to be
independent of velocity or position - pick one (or a linear
combination).  Most scientific work is done using the Einstein position
independent convention.  But sometimes the velocity independent anisotropic
convention is used.  
<p>
The one way speed of light cannot be measured - only the round trip time.
(Think about it.) The Einstein convention defines the speed of light as ½ the
round trip time, which makes relative timings independent of position.  The
anisotropic convention defines the one-way trip time as approaching zero 
coming toward the observer, and approaching the round trip time the other way.
This makes the timing of events for a given position independent of the
velocity of the observer.  
<p>
Neither convention is right or wrong.  But events 14×10⁹ light years
distant that are 6 months apart from a stationary observer, are
26 million years apart from the earth because of the difference in velocity
on opposite sides of its orbit with the Einstein convention.  The difference
in position, on the other hand, is insignificant for observations from earth
under the anisotropic convention.

<h4>Big Bang</h4>

<a href="http://sixdayscience.com/2013/02/25/six-days-of-creation/">
6 day science</a> makes the light of quark confinement the cosmic
clock by which the days are measured.  They claim that the Bible uses light
from day 1 as the time standard.  The age of the universe is measured
by the distance to the stars, and the speed of light using the Einstein
synchrony convention.
<p>
Before quark confinement, the primary matter of heavens and earth were mixed
together.  Space expanded a factor of 10¹² since quark confinement.  14×10⁹
years ÷ 10¹² = 5.1 days.  Corrected for acceleration of expansion: 5.5 days.

Note that although this theory concentrates a huge amount
(2<sup>10<sup>80</sup></sup> according to an estimate by Roger Penrose
in "The Emperors New Mind") of entropy reversal in the Big Bang on the first
day, the other days are also guided - God is still forming and ordering the
heavens and the earth throughout.

<h4>Young Earth (and Universe)</h4>

The young earth people know about relativity too.  
<a href="https://answersingenesis.org/">Answers in Genesis</a> claims
that the Bible uses the <a
href="https://answersingenesis.org/astronomy/starlight/anisotropic-synchrony-convention-distant-starlight-problem/">Anisotropic
Synchrony Convention</a> with the earth as the frame of reference to measure
The anisotropic convention uses a near instant speed one way, and slower
return trip.  With earth as the frame of reference, that convention
makes what we see in the sky recent (6000 years) history rather than
14 billion years ago.  
<p>
Light provides support for their position.  Blue stars, which are short
lived, are ubiquitous, even in the most distant galaxies - and their formation
is still not understood.  Spiral wrapping is about the same for the nearest and
most distant spiral galaxies.  Earth's magnetic field should not have lasted 4
billion years. 

<h4>Augustine</h4>

In 1:1, the heavens include the realm of angels as well.  In 1:3, He says
"Let there be" for the angels are enlightened and understand the Word of God,
and thereby receive even the Word that enlightens them.  They are the
audience for the days of creation.
<p>
Light is not only corporeal light, but also spiritual light, by which
unenlightened intellectual beings become enlightened.  Even
more mysterious than the origin of life is the origin of human consciousness.
