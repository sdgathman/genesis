<h3> Genesis 48,49 </h3>

<h4> The Death of Jacob </h4>

<ul>
<li> 48:10,11 Israel physical eyes were dim, but God showed him Joseph's
	seed.
<li> 48:14 Israel crosses his arms, seeing with spiritual eyes.
<li> 48:16 "let my name be upon them" - Israel adopts Ephraim and Mannasseh.
<li> 48:19 "I know it" - Israel saw perfectly well through the eyes of faith.
	Unlike earlier times, Israel was in charge and walking by the Spirit.
	Hebrews 11:21
<li> 48:22 "one portion more" - Shechem Joshua 24:32 and John 4:5, but
	also a double portion by Israel adoption Ephraim and Mannasseh.
<li> 49:1 "what shall befall you in the last days" - prophecy follows.
	See Deuteronomy 33
<li> 49:2 "sons of Jacob", "Israel your Father" - again with the two
	names.  Israel was walking in the Spirit, his sons in the flesh.
<li> 49:4 "thou shalt not excel" - no prophets, no kings, no judges.  
	Reubens numbers decrease between the two numberings in Numbers.
	Reuben doesn't even take an inheritance in the land.  
	"unstable as water" - unreliable, like streams that spring up
	in the desert and then disappear.
	"father's bed" - Reuben tried to take his fathers place
	prematurely.  Who does that remind you of?
<li> 49:7 "divide in Jacob" - Joshua 19, "scatter in Israel" Joshua 18:7, 
	Joshua 21
<li> 49:8 "Judah" - "praise", "thy father's children shall bow" - Joseph
	received the birthright, but Judah receives the eternal kingship with
	David much later.
<li> 49:10 "the sceptre shall not depart from Judah until Shiloh come".  
  "Shiloh" means "the one who is worthy".  (Revelation 5)
  The sceptre is the power of capital punishment.  (See Esther 4:11)
<p>
  When Caponius was appointed Procurated (around 7 A.D.), the legal power of
  the Sanhedrin was restricted and adjudication of capital offenses was lost.
  Cf. Josephus, Wars of the Jews, 2:8; Antiquities 20:9.  (See Luke 2:42-52)
<p>
  Then said Pilate unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law.
  The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to
  death: That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spake,
  signifying what death he should die. John 19:31-32
<li> 49:11 	the wine district of Israel: 2 Chronicles 26:10, also
	Engedi.  "ass's colt to the choice vine" - who is the Choice Vine?
	"clothes in the blood of grapes" Isaiah 63, Revelation 19
</ul>
