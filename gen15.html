<h3> The Table of Nations </h3>

Genesis 10 enumerates the ancestors of all the peoples of today.  Tim
Osterholm has an <a href="http://www.soundchristian.com/man/">
excellent integration</a> of this with current DNA and linquistic evidence,
which is excerpted below.  
<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-8.htm">Deuteronomy 32:8</a>
says that the boundaries of these 70 nations were set according to the
number of the <a href="gen52.html">sons of Israel who went to Egypt</a>.

<ul>
<li> 10:2 Madai - father of the Medes, Aryans, and India indians<br>
	Javan - Greece<br>
	Tubal - Tubalsk<br>
	Meshech - Moscow
<li> 10:3 The Askaeni were descendants of Ashkenaz, son of Gomer, son of
Japheth.  When the Askaeni arrived in northern Europe, they named the land
Ascania after themselves, which later translated Scandia, then Scandinavia.
Later in history, we find the Askaeni being referred to as Sakasenoi, which
became Sachsen, and finally Saxon.  The Saxons played an large part in European
and English history.  Ashkenaz has been one of the most well preserved names
throughout European history. 
<p>
Gomer - father of the Celts.
<li> 10:4 Historical evidence strongly suggests the first inhabitants of the
British isles were the descendants of Javan (from his sons Elishah and
Tarshish), and of Gomer and Magog.  Gomerites are today's modern Welsh.
Traditional Welsh belief is that the descendants of Gomer arrived about three
hundred years after the flood, and the Welsh language was once called Gomeraeg.
The Welsh (Celts) are thought to have created Stonehenge.  Additionally, the
descendants of Tarshish (Elishah's brother) appear to have settled on the
British Isles in various migrations about the same time.  Genesis 10:4 refers
to Tarshish as those of "the isles of the Gentiles."  The Phoenicians traded
silver, iron, tin and lead with them (Ezekiel 27:7,12), and even mention the
incredible stone monuments at Stonehenge.  Around 450 B.C., ancient historian
Herodotus wrote about shipments of tin coming from the "Tin Isles" far to the
north and west.  There is no question that the British isles, including the
northern coast of Spain, were the seat of the tin trade.  King Solomon acquired
precious metals from Tarshish (1 Kings 10:22).  English historians assert that
British mines mainly supplied the glorious adornment of Solomon's Temple, and
in those days the mines of southwestern Britain were the source of the world's
supply of tin.
<p>
The name Briton originated from Brutus (a descendant of Elishah), the first
king on Britain's mainland, arriving about 1100 B.C.  Two sons of Brutus,
Kamber and Albanactus, are referenced in English prehistory.  From Kamber came
Cambaria and the Cambrians (who integrated with the Gomerites [mostly Celts]
and became the present-day Welsh).  The descendants of Albanactus were known as
the Albans (or the Albanach whom the Irish commonly called them).  Geographers
would later call the land Albion. 

<li> 10:6 Mizraim - founder of Egypt
<li> 10:7 "Cush" literally means "black".  He is the father of Cushites,
Nubians, Ethiopians, Ghanaians, Africans, Bushmen, Pygmies, Australian
Aborignies, New Guineans, other related groups. There are many native African
tribes which trace themselves back traditionally to Ham.  The Yoruba, who are
black skinned, for example, claim to be descendants of Cush, and the Beja
people have specific genealogical traditions of descent from Cush.  Ethiopians
still trace their ancestry back to Cush.
<li> 10:9-10 Nimrod - founder of Babylon, forerunner of the Antichrist
<li> 10:11 Asshur - father of the Assyrian empire
<li> 10:14 The origin of the Philistines
<li> 10:15 Sidon - father of Tyre and Sidon
<li> 10:17 Sinites - founded the Chinese empire, which later had many influxes
  of invaders from Africa and Siberia, resulting in the mix of languages
  and cultures today.
<li> 10:23 Uz - Job 1:1
<li> 10:25 Eber - father of the Hebrews.  Peleg is named after the
	dividing of the earth.  
<li> 10:29 Jobab, or Job, was the nephew of Peleg, and the book
	of Job is full of <a href="http://setterfield.org/Jobab.html">
	references to the rapid changes in the earth</a>, including
	Tsunami's (Job 12:15, 7:12), Vulcanism (18:15), Violent winds 
	(1:19,27:20-21), Rapid Climate Change (6:15-18,38:29-30), Earthquakes
	(9:5-6) rapidly decreasing lifespans (8:8-9).  Job lived
	248 years, similar to sons of Peleg.
	<p>
	In general, much of the imagery of Job describes the aftershocks
	of the upheaval that exposed the earths mantel to release its
	water to flood the earth.  Modern geology maintains that continental
	drift occurred over a much longer period of time than a few hundred
	years.  I suspect they are wrong, and that has dramatic implications
	for strata based dating.
