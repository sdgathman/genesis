<h3> Genesis 47 </h3>

<ul>
<li> 47:6 Goshen was the best of Egypt.  When Jesus returns, Palestine
	will be the best place in the world.  Isaiah 35:1-2  Thanks
	to the provision of Joseph in 46:34, they were "in Egypt, but
	not of Egypt".
<li> 47:9 "pilgrimage" - everything here is temporary.
<li> 47:10 "Jacob blessed Pharaoh" - a fulfilment of 12:3, Pharaoh had
	blessed Israel the best of the land and with food.  Now Pharaoh 
	is blessed.
<li> 47:11 Joseph placed Israel in the best part of the land of Egypt,
	symbolic of the world, as a land of their own.  Jesus will place Israel
	in Palestine, the best part of the world when restored to pristine
	beauty and fertility.  
<li> 47:15 "The Egyptians" - The priests and Israel were supported by Pharaoh.
	Israel was an invited guest.  Question: were any Egyptians able
	to save their own seed, and thus avoid selling everything to
	the government?  
<li> 47:17 The Egyptians were worshiping cattle at the Exodus, and probably
	here also.
<li> 47:22 Pharaoh now owned everything except the Egyptian priests, and the
	children of Israel.
<li> 47:24 Pharaoh was already able to levy a 20% tax in the good years.
	What has changed?
<li> 47:27 "grew and multiplied" - Isaiah 60, the wealth of the nations
	will be brought to Israel, and they will live in peace. Ezekiel 34:25-26
<li> 47:28 The first 17 years of Joseph's life were spent with Jacob.  The
	last 17 years of Jacob's life were spent with Joseph.
<li> 47:31 "bowed himself on the bed" 1 Kings 1:47-48.  Beds and chairs 
	in Egypt (at least for the middle and upper class) were very similar to
	ours, with four feet (often carved like the feet of cattle), a frame,
	and a thin mattress.  The pillow was usually a stone, however.  The
	stone provided welcome coolness in the heat.
