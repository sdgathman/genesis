<h3>Simple Phonemes</h3>

The pronounciation of ancient Hebrew almost certainly changed a lot
over the 2000 years since Moses, and there were regional dialects (see
<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/12-6.htm">Judges 12:6</a>).  Scholars have only theories, and
modern Israeli Hebrew has dropped many of the distinct consonants and 
vowels, to be easier to learn for European Jews.  However, we will try to
learn "university" Hebrew - scholarly guesses at ancient Hebrew.  These
are some simple terms to describe unfamiliar sounds:

<h3><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a></h3>

We know absolutely from St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-11.htm">1 Corinthians 10:11</a>) that Genesis is to be
taken figuratively, and from the words of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-46.htm">John 5:46</a>), it is to be taken
prophetically.  It is also literal, for these things *did* happen to them, for
Christ says that Abraham was.  (So we can discount for the purposes of this
class theories that Genesis or parts of it are purely allegorical.)  But there
is still much controversy over what exactly *is* the "Literal Meaning of
Genesis" - especially with the creation and flood stories.

<h3> Overview of Theories of Genesis 1 </h3>

Augustine Literal Meaning of Genesis, Book 1, Chap 19: Embarassment of bad
science presented as sacred truth to unbelievers.  All theories of Genesis must acknowledge certain facts to be valid.
<ul>
<li> 1:5 י֥וֹם אֶחָֽד (day one) refers to a day and night cycle.  While yom can
mean "age", it never, ever means "age" with a number.  And just in case you
still try to weasel out of it, וַֽיְהִי־ עֶ֥רֶב וַֽיְהִי־ בֹ֖קֶר (and evening was and morning
was) makes it absolutely clear.  However, this does not rule out "day-age"
theories, since a day is defined by the observer (both in modern relativity
and in first millenium Greek science).
<li> The Earth *appears* to be much older than 6000 years from earth's frame
of reference.  This does not rule out "young earth" theories, as it may only
appear to be old.  
<li> God is the actor in the text.  Undirected evolution is not compatible
with Genesis.
<li> Genesis does not say when the earth was created.
  The 4004BC date derived from genealogies only tells when Adam was created. 
</ul>

There is no absolute time in our modern universe.  There is not even a one true
ordering of events.  This has been confirmed many times.  To specify
a measurement of time, you must also specify the observer (or "frame of
reference").  Genesis does not explicitly specify the observer, and
the theories differ mainly in the presumed observer of the days.

<dl>
<dt>Christianized Greek</dt>
  <dd> We will read selections from Augustine addressing theories of Genesis in
  the early church, including adaptations of Greek Cosmology.  This will
  remind us that science is always changing, and presenting it as
  sacred truth is foolishness.  The "firmanent" was the celestial sphere,
  which kept Chaos ("waters") outside the ordered universe.
<dt>Young Earth</dt>
  <dd> The days of Genesis one are measured from the frame of reference of Adam
  (even though Adam could not be the observer).
  This makes light 5 days older than Adam.  Furthermore, "in the beginning"
  is assumed to be the same day as light was created - making the universe
  5 days older than Adam.  This still doesn't explain how the earth *appears*
  to be much older, so in addition there is the ...
<dt><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omphalos_hypothesis">
Omphalos Hypothesis</a></dt>
  <dd>Did Adam have a belly button?  Did the trees in the
  Garden have rings?  Omphalos is Greek for "belly button", and 
  accordingly Adam did have a belly button, and the trees had rings.
  All things were created mature.  Apparent age is based on comparison
  with the observed development of a similar process, and is based on 
  assumptions for unique events like cosmology.
  </dd>
<dt>Day Age</dt>
  <dd> The observer is God, with whom "a day is as a thousand years".
  By extension, each day is an age.  Not because yom can mean "age"
  (it doesn't in Genesis) but because God is the observer, and He is
  outside time.  Each day is interpreted as an epoch in the formation
  of earth and development of life according to 20th century science.
  </dd>
<dt>Framework Theory</dt>
  <dd> The observers were the Angels, Job 38.  Augustine favored this
  view.  The angels do not inhabit our universe, or its time.  So there
  is no corresponding earth measurement.  In this view, the days are 
  days of a "seminar" where the design of the new world is proclaimed
  as three realms, with rulers of each realm:
  <table border=1>
  <tr>
  <td>
  1. The realm of light and darkness.<br>
  2. The realm of sea and sky.<br>
  3. The realm of dry land.<br>
  </td>
  <td>
  4. Sun to rule day, moon and stars to rule night.<br>
  5. Fish to rule sea, birds to rule sky.<br>
  6. Animals to rule dry land. <br>
  <td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td colspan="2" align="center">Man to rule over all.</td>
  </tr>
  </table>
  </dd>
<dt><a href="https://sixdayscience.com/six-days-2/">Big Bang Theory</a></dt>
  <dd> The observer is the cosmic background radiation.  The universe was 
  formless during the first few moments, vibrating as it expanded and cooled,
  until matter cooled enough to separate from light. That first light is still
  visible (at microwave frequencies now), and it records the <a
  href="http://faculty.washington.edu/jcramer/BigBang/Planck_2013/BBSnd20.wav">
  vibrations of the universe</a> for the first few minutes (from the reference
  frame of the light) after the separation of darkness (matter) and light.
  From the point of view of the cosmic background, the universe is about 5½
  days old.  The days of Genesis are stages in the evolution of the universe,
  and then our earth.  It is Day Age updated for modern cosmology.

<dt>Gap Theory Modifier</dt>
  <dd>Genesis<a href="https://biblehub.com//1-2.htm"> 1:2</a> can be translated, "but the earth became formless and an empty
  waste".  The idea is that the earth created in<a href="https://biblehub.com//1-1.htm"> 1:1</a> was destroyed by the fall
  of Lucifer, and made inhabitable again beginning in<a href="https://biblehub.com//1-3.htm"> 1:3</a>.  This theory 
  must be combined with one of the others to specify an observer of the days.
