<h3> Genesis 38 </h3>

<ul>
<li> 38:1 Judah leaves the family after Joseph is gone, apparently out of
	rebellion (and maybe disgust), and lives among the Caananites.  His
	friends are Caananites. 
<li> 38:2 Judah hooks up with (it says "took", same word as Shechem and Dinah)
	a Caananite "looker" in disobedience to God's instruction, and without
	consulting his father. However, 38:12 calls her his wife, so it
	seems to be a Vegas marriage.  "Daughter of Shua", i.e. Bathshua.  This
	also illustrates why Israel needed to be kept separate in Egypt until
	the iniquity of Caananites was complete. According to Pink, Shua means
	"riches".
<li> 38:3 Er - "watchful" 
<li> 38:4 Onan - "strong"
<li> 38:5 Shelah - "request" By the time Shelah is born, the family has
	move to Chezib - "deception".  Judah is living in Deception.
<li> 38:6 Tamar will be hitting Judah on the head with a clue bat.
<li> 38:7 Tamar - "palm tree", i.e. "graceful".  Bathshua was apparently
	instilling Caananite culture in Judah's sons.  The very reason why
	Israel was commanded to remain separate.  But then Jacob had laid the
	groundwork by taking his family to Shechem instead of going to Bethel
	as God told him.  Having recognized his own mistake in insisting on
	choosing his own wife, Judah doesn't give Er that courtesy.  The
	marriage arrangement was no doubt of mutual benefit to the two families
	- but it is a disaster for Tamar.  However, God chose Tamar to be the
	line of Christ.
<p>
	No details are given of Er's sin, but he shattered any girlhood
	hopes of Tamar.  While God has personally killed groups of people,
	Er is the first individual that God personally kills.
<li> 38:10 Onan refuses to give Tamar an inheritance, and is also judged.
	Levirate marriage was part of the code of Hammurabi, and
	later incorporated in the Law of Moses.  With Er childless,
	Onan inherits two thirds of the estate.  If he gives Er
	a child through Tamar, he only gets one fourth.  This is
	called conflict of interest.  Onan loses his life trying to
	save it.
<li> 38:11 Tamar is now engaged to the young Shelah.  "lest he die" - Judah had
	no intention of giving Tamar her inheritance.  He had no faith like
	Abraham that God would keep his promise of the Seed.  He had tainted
	the line with Bathshua, and was living in Deception.
<li> 38:13 The road from Adullam to Timnah goes right by Tamar's home.
<li> 38:14 Tamar takes drastic action to become a mother in Israel.  
	Reading between the lines, Judah must have told her (or her
	father) of his birthright when selecting a good wife for Er.
	By faith, she sees and desires that godly inheritance, but like
	Rebecca before her, she helps God out.  
<li> 38:15 Springtime in Caananite culture was when temple prostitutes
	were available to encourage the fertility of Baal and Ishtar.
	They wore a veil to conceal their identity during the ritual sex.
<li> 38:16 The fact that Tamar could plan on Judah visiting a temple prostitute
	shows the terrible state of Judah's character.  This is
	in stark contrast to Joseph in the next chapter.
<li> 38:23 Judah couldn't see how his tokens were of any use to the
	prostitute.
<li> 38:24 The penalty for adultery (including while engaged) in the
	code of Hammurabi, and later in the Torah, was death.  
<li> 38:26 But not for the men, obviously.  The Scripture does not use the word
	"righteous" lightly.  This is how we know Tamar acted in faith -
	without faith it is impossible to please God.  This is also a turning
	point in Judah's life.  He returns to his family, and shows an entirely
	different character in his protection of Benjamin.  Tamar has not only
	rescued her dead husbands from extinction, but rescued Judah from
	Deception.
<li> 38:28 In a strange parallel with Rebecca's twins, one is marked
	with red and the younger supplants the older.  Perez is the ancestor
	of Christ.
<li> 38:29 Although Judah was to be ruler in Israel, in Mosaic law, an
	illegitimate son did not receive an inheritance until the 10th
	generation.  In Ruth 4:18-22, we see that David is the 10th generation
	from Judah.
