<h3> The Flood </h3>

Genesis 8

<ul>
<li> 7:24 Revelation 9:5.  Similarly, the 6th trumpet apparently has
the same length of time as the flood.
<li> 8:1 "ark" is translated "coffin" elsewhere.  We are buried with Christ
in baptism.
<li> 8:4 17th day of the 7th month: coincidentally, 3 days after Passover,
also a Tuesday, as in 8:5.
<li> 8:5 James Jordan worked out the 
<a href="http://www.biblicalhorizons.com/biblical-chronology/6_04/">days of the
week</a> for the flood year, and the first day of the 10th month was a
Tuesday, the day dry land appeared. The flood ended on a Thursday.  The flood
is recapitulation of the (re?)creation of Genesis 1.
<li> 8:17 Repeat of the command in Genesis 1
<li> 8:18-19 Not one was lost of man or beast or bird on the ark. John 18:9 "Of
them which thou gavest me have I lost none." 
<li> 8:21 Revelation says there will be "no more curse", so this means 
cursing the environment is no longer effective at curtailing evil - especially
since mankind will be cursing the ground for himself, being of evil heart.
<li> 8:22 "While the earth remains."  Read the fine print.
</ul>
