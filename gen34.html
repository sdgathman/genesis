<h4> Genesis 29: The Rights of the Firstborn </h4>

Deuteronomy 32:9-14 Jacob's time with Laban in song

<ul>
<li> 29:1 "lifted his feet" - Jacob was walking on air, believing the
	promises he had received.
<li> 29:4 Eliezar, when he arrived at Haran seeking a wife for Isaac,
	immediately asks the Lord for guidance.  Jacob asks the shepherds.
<li> 29:7 Jacob was trying to get rid of these guys.
<li> 29:10 The three references to his mother suggest the source of Jacobs 
	emotion.
<li> 29:15 "serve me" - Jacob lied to receive Isaacs blessing, "Let peoples
	serve thee."  But Jacob's first discipline is to serve Laban.
<li> 29:17 "tender eyed" - teary.  Either caring and compassionate - or 
	bleary eyed from allergies or dry desert air.  (Commentators are
	split.) 
<li> 29:26 Jacob gets another hard lesson.
<li> 29:31 Not just the reader, but God himself is heartbroken over
	Leahs rejection.  I note that while many OT saints had multiple
	wives, they only had one "favorite".  (Which sometimes changed.)
	Thus, modern divorce and remarriage is essentially serial polygamy.
	Apparently, while a man can father children by multiple women,
	he can only "cleave to" one.
<li> 29:32 Reu-ben - "see a son".  Because the Lord has seen my affliction.
<li> 29:33 Simeon - "hearing".  Because the Lord has heard that I was hated.
<li> 29:34 Levi - "attached".  Now this time my husband will be joined to me.
<li> 29:35 Judah - "praise". Now will I praise the Lord.  Leah continues
	the line of the Seed.  Leah is buried next to Sarah - Rachel has a tomb
	by herself.  
</ul>
