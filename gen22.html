<h3> Genesis 17 </h3>

<h4> The Convenent of Circumcision </h4>

<ul>
<li> 17:1  It has been 13 years since Abram hearkened to Sarah in unbelief.
13 typifies unbelief or rebellion, for example 14:4 "in the 13th year they
rebelled".    
<p style="padding-left:20pt">
Noah and Enoch <i>walked with God</i> (5:24,6:9) as friends.<br>
Abraham is bidden to <i>walk before Me</i> as a child.<br>
Israel is told to <i>walk behind Me</i> (Deuteronomy 13:4) as a servant.<br>
The Church is told to <i>walk in Him</i> (Colossians 2:6) in union.
</p>
"Be thou perfect" - entire, whole, no longer compromised by
the expedients of unbelief.  Matthew 5:48
<li> 17:5  Abram gets a new name.  Abram means "great father", Abraham means
	"great father of many".
<li> 17:6 Seven I Wills (compare Exodus 6:6-8)
<p>
<ol>
<li> I <i>will</i> make my covenant between me and thee. (17:2)
<li> I <i>will</i> multiply thee exceedingly. 
<li> I <i>will</i> make you exceedingly fruitful. (17:6)
<li> I <i>will</i> make nations of you.
<li> I <i>will</i> establish my covenant between me and your seed
	for an everlasting covenant. (17:7)
<li> I <i>will</i> give to you and your seed all the land of Caanan
	for an everlasting possession. (17:8)
<li> I <i>will</i> be their God.
</ol> 

<p>
<li> 17:9-14 God has more (unpleasant) instructions for Abraham.  We
	need a volunteer to report next time on:
	<i>What is the figurative meaning of circumcision?</i> 
	Deuteronomy 30:6
<li> 17:15 Sarai gets a new name. Sarai is the construct of "princess": 
	"princess of", i.e. princess of Abram or "My Princess".
	Sarah is simply "Princess" (feminine of Sar, "Prince") - no longer a
	possession.  Women's lib in 2000 BC.
<li> 17:17 Abraham does not believe, but God helps his unbelief.
<li> 17:19 Isaac means "laughter".  Abraham (and Sarah) laughed.
<li> 17:20 Ishmael begets 12 princes.  Jacob has 12 sons.
<li> 17:23-27 Abraham may have laughed, but he obeys promptly and
	completely.
</ul>
